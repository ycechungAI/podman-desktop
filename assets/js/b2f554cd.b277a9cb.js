However, it\\nhas not been easy to discover new extensions.\\n\\nWith 1.0 we show a list of featured extensions in the **Welcome**\\n[#2354](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2354), the **Dashboard** and in\\n**<icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Extensions**\\n[#2355](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2355). Check out the new\\nextensions for **Red Hat OpenShift Local** and the **Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift**!\\n\\n![Featured extensions](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/featured-extensions.png)\\n\\n### Featured Extensions\\n\\nSpeaking of extensions, let\'s take a minute to turn the spotlight on these two!\\n\\nHave another idea for extending Podman Desktop? We would love to hear from you or see\\nwhat you can create with the [Extension documentation](../docs/extensions),\\nand feature your extension here.\\n\\n#### Red Hat OpenShift Local\\n\\nOpenShift Local is a fully-featured single-node OpenShift cluster designed to run on your local computer.\\nWith this extension you can install, start/stop, and deploy pods or YAML to OpenShift Local,\\nallowing you to test your applications on a full OpenShift environment, ensuring a consistent\\nexperience between development, test, and production.\\n\\nThe recent addition of the MicroShift preset provides a lighter, optimized option that\\nstarts faster and uses less resources for deployments that still want OpenShift compatibility\\nwithout the full set of OpenShift services.\\n\\n![OpenShift Local](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/openshift-local.png)\\n\\n#### Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift\\n\\nThe OpenShift Developer Sandbox is a free, cloud-based OpenShift environment that allows developers to\\ncreate, build, and deploy applications to OpenShift for 30 days. With this extension you can sign up\\nand easily deploy pods or YAML to a hosted OpenShift environment without a local installation or\\nleaving Podman Desktop.\\n\\n![Developer Sandbox](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/sandbox.png)\\n\\n### Podman Machine as Root\\n\\nWhen creating a Podman machine you can now decide to run as root [#2427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2427). This is a prerequisite for some scenarios, such as running Kind on Windows.\\n\\n![Podman machine as root](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/podman-root.png)\\n\\n### Other UI and UX Improvements\\n\\n#### Prompt to Open External Website\\n\\nIn the previous release links to external websites were blocked due to the security risk.\\nIn 1.0 you can click to see the URL and have the option of opening or copying it\\n[#2414](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2414).\\n\\n![External link dialog](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/external-link.png)\\n\\n#### Editable Numeric Preferences\\n\\nTired of clicking +, +, +? Us too. Numeric preferences are now editable so\\nyou can directly enter the value you want\\n[#2368](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2368).\\n\\n![Editing numbers](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/edit-number.png)\\n\\n#### Navigation tooltips\\n\\nWe like our new navigation bar, but the tooltips were slow to appear. This made it harder for new\\nusers to discover the pages and for power users to see the container/pod/image counts. The\\ntooltips are now a little nicer and appear immediately\\n[#2286](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2286).\\n\\n![Navigation tooltips](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/nav-tooltips.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- If you use a non-default Podman machine you are now prompted to make it the default, so\\n  that command line tools will use the same machine [#2205](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2205).\\n\\n- Extensions can now be installed without requiring a running local container engine\\n  [#2273](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2273).\\n\\n- When extensions fail to load there is a new state (failed!) and an error message\\n  to help you fix or report the problem [#2424](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2424).\\n\\n- The showInputBox API has support for Markdown [#2418](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2418).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Fixed shared status when using multiple Podman 4.5 machines [#2441](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2441).\\n- Fixed hang on exit when telemetry is unreachable [#2431](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2431).\\n- Reduced initial Podman REST API calls to improve performance [#2419](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2419).\\n- **Play Kubernetes YAML** now honors the namespace [#2509](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2509).\\n- **Container** list was not remembering expand/collapsed status [#2491](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2491).\\n- Clear previous error when installing Docker extension [#2469](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2469).\\n- Ensure correct path with running Kind CLI [#2455](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2455).\\n- Use IPv4 over IPv6 by default [#2398](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2398).\\n- When changing the Kubernetes pod name, change the app name to match [#2389](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2389).\\n- Fixed incorrect pod status in **Containers** view [#2387](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2387).\\n- **Dashboard** wasn\'t correctly refreshing Podman status [#2359](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2359).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make Podman Desktop even better.

This allows you to take existing Kubernetes YAML definitons -\\nyour deployments, services, or other objects - and deploy it to the cluster.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/231812563-ece0a56a-b347-48f8-a3a7-400eb9449037.mp4\\" />\\n\\nAs you deploy pods, they will automatically appear in the list of **Pods** [1263](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1263), allowing you to start, stop, and interact them just like pods running on Podman.\\n\\nOne of the most common uses is to deploy a container that you have been running on Podman, and this will fail\\nif the image is not available in Kind. To solve this we have made it easy to push images from\\nPodman to Kind [1448](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1448).\\n\\n![push-image-kind](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/push-image-kind.png)\\n\\n### Kind Ingress\\n\\nIf you deploy a pod to Kind, you are also going to want to reach it! To do this you will need to install a load balancer or\\ningress controller so that the pod is accessible from outside the cluster. We made it easy to install the Contour ingress\\ncontroller while creating a Kind cluster [1675](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1675),\\nso if you created your cluster with Podman Desktop it is already there!\\n\\n![kind-ingress](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/kind-ingress.png)\\n\\nWe have several other Kind and Kubernetes features planned to expand the supported scenarios, but hopefully this\\nmakes it easy to get started with Kind and shows where we\'re headed. As always, feedback is appreciated!\\n\\n### UI and UX improvements\\n\\n#### Updated Preferences\\n\\nThe **<icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences** page has been updated with a new design [1913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1913),\\nmaking it easier to see and change preferences.

But the UI depends on Docker API and it is not possible to use the UI with Docker and Podman at the same time.\\n\\nPodman Desktop is a multi-engine UI tool. The UI is compatible with the API of Docker and Podman. It means all containers and images from all the engines at the same time are visible in the UI.\\n\\nWhen migrating from Docker to Podman, you can use Podman Desktop to interact with containers running in Docker. Explore all commands and features of Podman Desktop and see all the resources from Docker.\\n\\n![Many container engines at the same time](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/multiple-container-engines.png)\\n\\n## Docker compatibility mode\\n\\nUsing Podman with Podman Desktop or with the Podman CLI is straightforward. But some tools expect to find `docker` CLI or `docker.sock` socket. In this case, you have to use the compatibility mode of Podman.\\n\\n### Socket file compatibility\\n\\nThe socket compatibility mode is a feature of Podman that allows to bind the Podman socket under the Docker socket path.\\n\\nOn Windows the socket compatibility mode is always enabled by default. On macOS, by using the `.pkg installer` it is active by default. But when installing with `brew`, it will not be there because it requires some admin permissions.\\n\\nThat is not an issue because you can enable it by [invoking a CLI tool](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/using-podman-mac-helper) that will setup the compatibility mode.\\n\\nFor example if you use [`TestContainers`](https://www.testcontainers.org/) in your Java project, you can use the compatibility mode to ensure that the tool will use Podman instead of Docker.\\n\\n### CLI compatibility\\n\\nIf you have scripts relying on `docker` CLI, you can use the compatibility mode to ensure that the tool is working with Podman instead of Docker.\\n\\nIf you have the `docker` CLI installed on your computer, you can use the socket file compatibility of docker to ensure that the tool is working with Podman engine instead of Docker.\\n\\nIf you do not have the `docker` CLI installed on your computer, you can [Create a script](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/emulating-docker-cli-with-podman) called `docker` that will call the `podman` CLI\\n\\n**_NOTE:_** creating a shell prompt alias, for example `alias docker=podman`, will not work inside scripts that you call.\\n\\n## Compose\\n\\nAs a user of Docker, you might use `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`) to run some of your applications.\\n\\nFor now Podman does not include a `Compose` support directly in the CLI with a command `podman compose`.\\n\\n`Compose` can work with the Podman socket.\\n\\nBased on the compatibility mode (see [section about Docker compatibility mode](#docker-compatibility-mode)):\\n\\n- Enabled: you can use the `compose` binary to run your applications.\\n- Disabled: you need to [export the environment variable DOCKER_HOST](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/using-the-docker_host-environment-variable) before running compose.\\n\\nYou can now use the `compose` binary to run your applications and it will use Podman engine.\\n\\nPodman Desktop has a `compose` extension that can fetch `compose` binary if not already available on the filesystem.\\n\\nPodman Desktop UI displays the containers created by `Compose` are in the same group.\\n\\n![Compose support in the UI](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/compose-containers-in-ui.png)\\n\\n## Kubernetes\\n\\nIt is possible to start a Kubernetes cluster with Docker.\\n\\nPodman supports directly a subset of Kubernetes resources that you can use with `.yaml` files.\\n\\nFor example if you only want to create a `Pod` resource, you can use the `Play Kubernetes YAML` button from the `Containers` list screen with your `.yaml` file. No need to install or start a Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n![Play Kubernetes YAML](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/play-kubernetes-yaml.png)\\n\\nIt is possible to do the counter-part. Export the definition of a container or pod to a Kubernetes resource. You can use the `Generate kube` button from the kebab menu of a given container or pod.\\n\\n![Kubernetes generate](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/kube-generate.png)\\n\\nPodman handles pods and in the Podman Desktop UI, you can see all the pods inside a Pod section. All containers inside the pod are in the same group.\\n\\n![Pods in the UI](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/pods-in-ui.png)\\n\\n![Containers from pod](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/containers-from-pod.png)\\n\\nAn experimental `kind` extension is bringing the creation of full-blown Kubernetes cluster with Podman.\\n\\n## Rootless mode\\n\\nOne of the difference of Docker and Podman is the way they handle containers. Docker requires root privileges to run containers by default. Podman can run containers without root privileges by default.\\n\\nIt means that for example, starting a container with a port < 1024 will not work. You need to use a port > 1024.\\n\\nIf you still need to create containers with a port < 1024, you can change the Podman machine configuration of the Podman Machine if you are on Windows or macOS.\\n\\nThe command is `podman machine --rootful` to enable the execution with root privileges or `podman machine --rootful=false` to switch back to rootless mode."},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-0.12","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.12","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-15-release-0.12.md","title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.12","description":"Podman Desktop 0.12 has been released!","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":4.505,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Le Meur","title":"Product Manager","url":"https://github.com/slemeur","imageURL":"https://github.com/slemeur.png","key":"slemeur"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.12","description":"Podman Desktop 0.12 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-0.12","authors":["slemeur"],"tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"5 things to know about Podman Desktop for a Docker user","permalink":"/blog/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.11","permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.11"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nThis release note covers Podman Desktop 0.12 release changes.\\n\\n\x3c!--Main Features--\x3e\\n\\n- **Podman Version**: Podman 4.4.1 now included in Windows and Mac installers.\\n- **Containers Configuration**: Configure port mappings for an image without exported ports.\\n- **Windows Home Support**: Podman Desktop now supports Windows Home Edition.\\n- **Start minimized**: Option to start Podman Desktop minimized to system tray.\\n- **UX and UI Improvements**: Consistent actions, placeholder for logs, unified icons and others.\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.12 is now available.

When initializing a new Podman machine using all-in-one binaries, it\'ll use the embedded files and not grab them from internet:\\n\\n- on Mac, it embeds the qemu FCOS binaries.\\n- on Windows, it embeds the WSL binary.\\n\\nTo differentiate the air-gapped binaries from the regular ones, you can check the artifactname, they\'re containing \'airgap\' and are bigger.\\nPlease note, that those binaries are available only on releases and not the pre-releases.\\n\\nThere is also an optional way to provide a custom Podman machine image in the create machine form. By providing the path to the image you want, Podman Desktop will create a machine with that image. Leaving the field empty will use the default image (the one included in the binary).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/210508524-45005536-ac74-4074-92c1-2b3ca51d0073.mp4\' />\\n\\n### Feedback within Podman Desktop [#1078](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1078)\\n\\nSubmitting feedback on Podman Desktop is getting easier as it is possible directly within the tool. This will help to get more information about the issues you are facing and will help us to improve the tool.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/208938878-948a2764-d73b-4584-a80d-497c052482c1.mp4\' />\\n\\nPlease feel free to submit any feedback you have, we are looking forward to hearing from you!\\n\\n### Docker compatibility mode [#1047](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1047)\\n\\nThe Docker compatibility mode is a feature that allows to use Podman as a drop-in replacement for Docker. It relies on the Docker socket helper provided with Podman and automatically handle the local setup of Podman path to the Docker socket. Tools like [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) or others are relying on this to communicate to the container engine.\\n\\nIn this new version of Podman Desktop, we are now providing information to the user about the status of this compatibility mode directly on the dashboard page. The way it works is the following:\\n\\n- When Docker is running: the socket is pointing to Docker.\\n- When Podman is starting and Docker is not running: the docker API socket will use Podman.\\n\\nIn case the compatibility mode is not activated, new documentation on how to activate it and how to easily switch between Docker and Podman is available here: [https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker).\\n\\nThis is a warning displayed for Windows users:\\n![windows-docker-compatibility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/209305744-9056addd-f122-4f75-9e03-ad27a0109375.png)\\n\\nThis is the warning for Mac users:\\n![mac-docker-compatibility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/207964861-a9c1f72c-89d6-4816-beab-397af4125620.png)\\n\\n### Allow to toggle on/off the proxy setting [#983](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/983)\\n\\nIn some context, users need the ability to disable and re-enable the proxy configuration very quickly, without having to entirely reconfigure it. This is now possible from the Podman Desktop settings page, where a toggle to enable/disable the proxy configuration has been added.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/205955418-670bc37c-a74f-40ef-bc60-8d9d013aa0dc.mp4\' />\\n\\nNote: extensions can read this information and then update the proxy configuration.\\n\\n### Namespace selection for deploy to Kubernetes [#1008](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1008)\\n\\nA new dropdown menu has been added to the deploy to Kubernetes screen to allow selecting the namespace to deploy to. Defaults to defaultnamespace, if unable to get any from kube_client module.\\n\\nIf the user have set `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=NAMESPACE` it honors that as the chosen value.\\n\\n![deploy-kubernetes-namespace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7339809/206688886-095e4f15-42ae-4a0a-b1c6-ae4b547fcdfb.gif)\\n\\n### Configure Podman binary path [#941](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/941)\\n\\nUsers may use a custom path to the podman binary. An option within settings (Settings -> Preferences) to allow providing an additional path to Podman binary has been added. This is useful for users who have installed Podman using a package manager and want to use the binary provided by the package manager. Additional information is available in the documentation for Mac users: [http://podman-desktop.io/docs/troubleshooting#unable-to-set-custom-binary-path-for-podman-on-macos](http://podman-desktop.io/docs/troubleshooting#unable-to-set-custom-binary-path-for-podman-on-macos)\\n\\n![custom-path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/204832063-5858065a-2fc3-49de-8d23-3b99b7d10dbf.png)\\n\\n### Provide pre-defined registries [#1201](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1201)\\n\\nThe experience of configuring a registry is getting simplified for the most popular ones. The user will be able to select a registry from a pre-defined list and will only have to provide the username and password. The following registries will be pre-defined:\\n\\n- Dockerhub\\n- Red Hat Quay\\n- GitHub\\n- IBM Container Registry\\n- Google Container Registry\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/214332937-eb1d9050-0d32-4bc4-8393-49b4583b1390.mov\' />\\n\\n### UI/UX Improvements\\n\\n#### View Pods logs [#1122](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1122)\\n\\nThe pods details view provides the ability to view the logs of each containers that might be running in a pod. Moreover, as it can also be hard to scan and identify which container is producing which output, we appended the container name at the beginning of each output and differentiate each container with a different color.\\n\\n![pods-logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/211024673-eee9bad8-1b0c-4446-b8d1-97a226282c4d.png)\\n\\n#### Improved feedback when clicking on container list action icons [#1150](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1150) [#1161](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1161)\\n\\nWhen starting/stopping or deleting a container, a spinner is now displayed. In case of error, a message indicating that the action failed will also be better indicated.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211531610-2347d302-4918-46ae-a5a2-c80fac0314f5.mp4\' />\\n\\nFor containers that exit immediately or short-lived containers, the feedback is also improved and include report of error now provide a better feedback to the user [#1161](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1161).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211831905-ebf596d5-efc8-4f55-8cb8-3f31655388b9.mp4\' />\\n\\n#### Allows to change the default font size for the editor [#1160](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1160)\\n\\nAn editor is used in several screens of Podman Desktop, from the inspect screen to container\'s outputs and Kubernetes YAML. The default font size is 10 pixels. It\'s now possible to adjust the font size to the one the one you prefer. This setting is persisted and will be used for all the editors of Podman Desktop and available from the preferences page (Settings -> Preferences).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211778161-130ff733-b2ca-4306-bea3-d031196c3b29.mp4\' />\\n\\n#### Keep expanded state of pods when refreshing containers [#1042](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1042)\\n\\nWhen switching from different screens of the application or simply refreshing the list of containers, the expanded state of each item in the list is now persisted and will be properly restored.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/207864147-b68ea9bd-0ca9-42dc-882e-b8a705233749.mp4\' />\\n\\n#### Click on the Pod name redirects to the Pod details page [#1159](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1159)\\n\\nThe list of containers also displays pods, now clicking on the pod name directly redirects to the Pod details page.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211770946-2255f39f-7e2e-48ad-9ead-bcbfe6a115a7.mp4\' />\\n\\n#### Improved styles of buttons for actions [#984](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/984)\\n\\nThe style of the buttons for actions on item in the list of in details pages have been improved. The background has been removed, but to make the hover state more visible, the \\"hover\\" circle is visble and the icon\'s color is also changing.\\n\\nOn lists:\\n![list-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/205979121-b49a0ddf-03bb-4a4d-8d12-bc8d0bd52387.png)\\n\\nOn details pages:\\n![details-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/205979123-ea420b17-e834-4029-82eb-22949889eee9.png)\\n\\n#### Improved alignments in pages with lists [#1182](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1182)\\n\\nThe alignment of the items in the list of containers and pods have been improved. The header of each columns are now aligned with the text. and the actions icons are now aligned with the top of the text.\\n\\n![list-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/212712580-096fd090-0beb-40a4-8dc6-b3fdc5e81e35.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- Statistics area in container details are always shown.

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### New configuration wizzard to create containers ([#773](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/773))\\n\\nUntil now, we could only specify port binding when building images to start containers. The create container wizzard now includes several options enabling configuring volumes, environment variables, restart policy and settings on networking and security. It is also possible to reuse an existing (and already configured) a network when creating containers.\\n\\n![new container creation wizard](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/new_container_creation_wizard.gif)\\n\\n### Kubernetes Capabilities Improvements\\n\\n**Custom Kubeconfig file path ([#780](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/780))**\\n\\nKubeconfig path location is now configurable from **<icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences > Kubernetes: Kubeconfig** and can be set to a custom path. By default, Podman Desktop use the path `$HOME/.kube/config` for the Kubeconfig file.\\n\\n![custom kubeconfig file path](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/custom-kubeconfig.png)\\n\\n**Play Kubernetes YAML from the Pods list ([#739](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/739))**\\n\\nPodman Desktop enables to play existing Kubernetes YAML files. This is now available from `Play Kubernetes YAML` button added to the Pods list, in addition to the Containers list.\\n\\n![play k8s yaml](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/play_k8s_yaml.gif)\\n\\n**Kube context automatically reloaded when updated ([#813](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/813))**\\n\\nAny change to the kube context will now be detected by Podman Desktop in its running state. The system tray, allowing to select which Kubernetes environment to work with, will now reload the kube context without restarting Podman Desktop.\\n\\n### Revamped Container Registries UI ([#446](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/446))\\n\\nThe registries configuration UI has been revamped. Instead of using tiles for displaying the registries, now it uses a list where each registry can be added or edited directly in the list. The kebab menu provides options to edit or remove a registry from the list.\\n\\n![registries](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/registries.png)\\n\\n### Update to Podman 4.3.1 ([#913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/913))\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.10 is now embedding [Podman 4.3.1](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.3.1) in Windows and macOS installers.\\n\\n### UI/UX Improvements\\n\\n**Improved lists UX ([#877](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/877))**\\n\\nTo reduce the width used in the lists when displaying all the icons, main actions icons are now always displayed (before it was on hover) and the secondary actions are displayed in a kebab menu. For example Start/Stop and delete are primary actions while open the browser, inspect, generate kube yaml, etc. are secondary options.\\n\\n![kebab menu](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/kebab-menu.png)\\n\\n**Delay appearance of text in navbar ([#767](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/767))**\\n\\nWhen minimizing or expanding the navbar, the text was overlapping for a few second the page. Now it\'s displayed with a fading animation.\\n\\n**Selected state: better text color contrast ([#802](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/802))**\\n\\nIn the `Images` page, on hover for both the image and the name column, the text contrast has been increased for better visibility: violet indicates that you have selected it.\\n\\n![text color when hover](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/text-color.gif)\\n\\n**On Linux and Windows, the menu bar is now hidden by default ([#668](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/668))**\\n\\nWith this change, the menu bar looks more integrated to the Operating System. The menu can appear if you hit the `Alt` key. Thanks to [Dylan M. Taylor](https://github.com/dylanmtaylor) for contributing to fix this.\\n\\n**Exit when clicking on the close icon of the dashboard on Linux ([#671](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/671))**\\n\\nFor most users on Linux, there is no tray icon support. In this situation, when closed, Podman Desktop continues to run in background. [Dylan M. Taylor](https://github.com/dylanmtaylor) added a property to exit the app by default when clicking on the close icon. For people having tray icon support or with the desire of a different behavior, it is possible to disable it from the Settings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- Rename `Started` into `Age` in Containers list.([#878](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/878))\\n- Added domain validation when adding a registry. ([#838](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/838))\\n- Provided a consistent behavior with Podman CLI, `podman-machine-default` is now the default name when creating a Podman machine from Podman Desktop. ([#775](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/775))\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable bug fixes\\n\\n- Fixed error handling when pulling images of Desktop Extensions. ([#782](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/782))\\n- Fixed use of the full height of the screen when displaying log in the details of a container. ([#946](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions/946))\\n- Fixed First start of Podman Desktop on flatpak was not seeing the podman engine ([#860](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/860))\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make Podman Desktop 0.10 even better:\\n\\n- [Dylan M.

The Development Container works locally using Visual Studio Code but in this blog post we will see how it works directly with a simple click from GitHub.\\n\\nThe challenges are to run a desktop tool (Podman Desktop) and running a container engine (Podman) inside this Development Container without using too many memory !\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Defining image of the container\\n\\nThe first thing is in the choice of the image for the container. It is possible to pick-up a default image and add some features but there is no existing feature for Podman at <https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src> and most of the features are expecting to run on top of Debian/Ubuntu\\n\\nIf you are not interested in how to setup the image, jump to the [next section](#configure-the-devcontainer-using-devcontainerjson).\\n\\nPodman binaries are available quickly after the releases for Fedora. I decided then to use `Fedora 37` as the base image.\\n\\nLet start the Containerfile using:\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM quay.io/fedora/fedora:37\\n```\\n\\nThen I install Node.js 16 from official nodejs.org repository. It\'s easier to switch to the version that we need.\\n\\n```docker\\n# install Node.js + yarn\\nENV NODE_VERSION 16.18.1\\nRUN curl -SLO \\"https://nodejs.org/dist/v$NODE_VERSION/node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" && \\\\\\n    tar -xzf \\"node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 && \\\\\\n    rm \\"node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" && \\\\\\n    npm install -g yarn\\n```\\n\\nNow, all system dependencies used to run an Electron application needs to be installed.\\n\\nPodman is also installed so we can run some containers inside this container.\\n\\nAnd of course, we need to install VNC (I choose [tigervnc](https://tigervnc.org/)) with a light Window Manager ([fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)).\\n\\nTo connect to the display of the container, we need to expose VNC over HTML/websocket using [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)\\n\\nxterm is installed to start a terminal from the VNC side.\\n\\n```docker\\nRUN dnf -y update && \\\\\\n    yum -y reinstall shadow-utils && \\\\\\n    yum install -y git \\\\\\n                   # dependencies for Podman Desktop\\n                   nss \\\\\\n                   atk \\\\\\n                   at-spi2-atk \\\\\\n                   cups-libs \\\\\\n                   gtk3 \\\\\\n                   # for remote Display\\n                   fluxbox \\\\\\n                   tigervnc-server \\\\\\n                   xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 \\\\\\n                   novnc \\\\\\n                   supervisor \\\\\\n                   xdpyinfo \\\\\\n                   # for podman\\n                   podman \\\\\\n                   fuse-overlayfs --exclude container-selinux \\\\\\n                   xterm && \\\\\\n    rm -rf /var/cache /var/log/dnf* /var/log/yum.*\\n```\\n\\nSupervisord setup the launch of the VNC server and the Window manager\\n\\n```docker\\nCOPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf\\n```\\n\\nA custom theme for fluxbox:\\n\\n```docker\\nCOPY fluxbox /usr/share/fluxbox/init\\n```\\n\\nThen we need a special configuration to allow to have Podman working inside the container\\n\\nWe add the `podman-desktop` user with correct range on subuid and subgid when running containers. I used the [tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#etcsubuid-and-etcsubgid-configuration).\\n\\n```docker\\nRUN useradd -u 1000 podman-desktop && echo podman-desktop:10000:5000 > /etc/subuid && echo podman-desktop:10000:5000 > /etc/subgid\\n```\\n\\nThen use some default configuration files\\n\\n```docker\\n# initialize conf files\\nADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/libpod/master/contrib/podmanimage/stable/containers.conf /etc/containers/containers.conf\\nADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/libpod/master/contrib/podmanimage/stable/podman-containers.conf /home/podman-desktop/.config/containers/containers.conf\\n```\\n\\nand make sure that all permissions are correct following the guide [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container)\\n\\n```docker\\n# set permissions\\nRUN chown podman-desktop:podman-desktop -R /home/podman-desktop && chmod 644 /etc/containers/containers.conf && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p /var/lib/shared/overlay-images /var/lib/shared/overlay-layers /var/lib/shared/vfs-images /var/lib/shared/vfs-layers; touch /var/lib/shared/overlay-images/images.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/overlay-layers/layers.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/vfs-images/images.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/vfs-layers/layers.lock && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p /run/user/1000 && chown podman-desktop:podman-desktop /run/user/1000\\n```\\n\\nplus define an empty user namespace.\\n\\n```docker\\nENV _CONTAINERS_USERNS_CONFIGURED=\\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nMake sure Podman will create the socket in an expected directory:\\n\\n```docker\\n# socket path for podman\\nENV XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000\\n```\\n\\nOK ! we have a custom Containerfile providing all the tools to build and run Podman Desktop (using VNC for the display), run Podman and run Electron.\\n\\nThe current file is available at <https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/.devcontainer/.parent/Containerfile>\\n\\nLet\'s configure the DevContainer.\\n\\n## Configure the DevContainer using devcontainer.json\\n\\nDevContainer definition is stored at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.\\n\\nWe need to reuse the image of the previous step. For that let\'s use the build section of the `devcontainer.json` file.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"build\\": {\\n  \\"dockerfile\\": \\"Containerfile\\"\\n},\\n```\\n\\nIn order to avoid to redo all the build steps each time we open a workspace using this dev container, we published the image to quay.io at [quay.io/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent:next\\n](https://quay.io/repository/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent?tab=tags&tag=next). This parent image is not changing much so it\'s better to use is as a parent one.\\n\\nInside `.devcontainer` directory there is a `.parent` directory with everything related to the parent image.\\n\\nAnd in the `.devcontainer/Containerfile` file we reference this image\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM quay.io/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent:next\\n```\\n\\nBy default, we will be `root` in the container and this is probably not what we expect. Let\'s change that.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"containerUser\\": \\"podman-desktop\\"\\n```\\n\\nSome Visual Studio Code extensions are nice to use and we can add them\\n\\n```json\\n  \\"extensions\\": [\\"svelte.svelte-vscode\\", \\"bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThen here is the tricky part, how to run our container allowing to run again inside the container some containers with podman.\\n\\nWe specify the arguments to make it possible. It\'s possible to use `--privileged` flag but I prefer to list the subset of permissions.\\nUsing `--privileged` we don\'t really know what are the privilege that are required while specifying all of them, people are aware of what is granted/denied.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"runArgs\\": [\\n    \\"--cap-add=sys_admin\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"seccomp=unconfined\\",\\n    \\"--device\\",\\n    \\"/dev/fuse\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"label=disable\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"apparmor=unconfined\\"\\n  ],\\n```\\n\\nSource code of Podman Desktop needs to be editable within the DevContainer so it needs to be mounted.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"workspaceMount\\": \\"source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/workspace,type=bind\\",\\n\\"workspaceFolder\\": \\"/workspace\\",\\n```\\n\\nThen we need a command to build Podman Desktop.\\n\\nFor that, we use `onCreateCommand` hook with a custom command\\n\\n```json\\n\\"onCreateCommand\\": \\"${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/onCreateCommand.sh\\",\\n```\\n\\nand in the `.devcontainer` folder the `onCreateCommand.sh` script is the following\\n\\n```shell\\n#!/bin/sh\\nyarn\\n\\nMODE=production yarn run build && yarn run electron-builder build --linux --dir --config .electron-builder.config.cjs\\n```\\n\\nTwo instructions:\\n\\n1. Fetch all Node.js dependencies.\\n2. build Podman Desktop in the `dist` folder using `Linux` as target Operating System.\\n\\nAfter the start of the container, how to launch Podman Desktop, the website and VNC, etc ?\\n\\nJust use `postStartCommand` hook.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"postStartCommand\\": \\"${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/postStartCommand.sh\\",\\n```\\n\\nand in the `.devcontainer` folder the `postStartCommand.sh` script is the following:\\n\\n```shell\\n#!/bin/sh\\n\\n# Start all services\\n/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisord.conf &\\n\\n# wait X server to be ready or after 2mn exit\\necho \\"Waiting for X server to be ready\\"\\ntimeout 120 bash -c \'until xdpyinfo -display :0 &> /dev/null; do printf \\".\\"; sleep 1; done\'\\n\\n# launch podman desktop\\necho \\"Launching Podman Desktop\\"\\ncd dist/linux-unpacked/&& ./podman-desktop &\\n\\n# Launch the 9000 redirect after 20 seconds\\nsleep 20\\nwebsockify --web=/usr/share/novnc localhost:9000 localhost:5900 &\\n\\n# launch the website rendering\\necho \\"Launching Website\\"\\ncd website && yarn start\\n```\\n\\nIt starts VNC and noVNC, start precompiled Podman Desktop and start the documentation rendering.\\n\\nIt is not launching the Watch mode/development mode of Podman Desktop as it requires a container having more than 8GB of memory.\\n\\nPicking up a larger instace with for example 16GB, it\'s possible to use development mode.\\n\\nOf course, to make VNC happy, we need to specify the `DISPLAY` environment variable.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"remoteEnv\\": {\\n  \\"DISPLAY\\": \\":0\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen the DevContainer is fully available, we want to have a way to quickly open the `Website rendering URL` and `noVNC`\\n\\nLet\'s tweak the `devcontainer.json` file by adding the `portsAttributes` section\\n\\n```json\\n\\"portsAttributes\\": {\\n  \\"9000\\": {\\n    \\"label\\": \\"vnc\\",\\n    \\"onAutoForward\\": \\"openPreview\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"3000\\": {\\n    \\"label\\": \\"website\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter all post-creation steps, the `Preview` browser inside the VS Code editor will open a window to VNC. And another port (`3000`) is flagged for the website.\\n\\n## Using the DevContainer.json on Github Codespace\\n\\nAs a user, opening a workspace with all what we configured is done using a single click.\\n\\nGo to <https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop> then click on the `< > Code` dropdown and click on `Create codespace on main` button.\\n\\n![Open Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-click-repository.png)\\n\\nOnce you click on the button, the codespace is setting up:\\n\\n![Preparing Codepace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-preparing-codespace.png)\\n\\nAfter few minutes, as there is not yet [prebuilt codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds), the codespace is opening.\\n\\nThe simple Browser displays the noVNC window:\\n![Opening Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-open-novnc.png)\\n\\nClick on the connect button. Then on the terminal you can enter `podman run quay.io/podman/hello` and the container is detected in Podman Desktop.\\n![Testing Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-testing-podman-desktop.png)\\n\\nIt\'s also possible using the port widget to get on `3000` port by clicking on the world icon a preview of the website in another tab. Changing source code of the website will refresh the content of the window.\\n\\nDepending on the usecase, it\'s also possible to open documentation in the preview browser.\\n\\n![Edit website Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-edit-website.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe DevContainer image for Podman Desktop is recent so it\'ll probably evolve over time by adding new capabilities but it allows you to easily build/run/experiment and **contribute** to the tool or the website."}]}')}}]);
