Let\'s dive in!\\n\\n### Starting a container from scratch\\n\\nEver wanted to start a container effortlessly? Now, just enter the image (local or remote), select it from a dropdown, and with a single click, you\'ll get the perfect startup prompt. In no time, your container is swimming happily in its new environment!\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Starting a container from scratch\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/start-container-from-image-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/start-container-from-image-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Mirroring of Registries \u2013 No More Fishy Workarounds\\n\\nWhen creating a Podman machine from Podman Desktop, we now include a playbook that mounts the host\u2019s `registries.conf` into the VM at `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/`. To handle this configuration, simply click on \'More Actions\' in the Podman machine menu, and you\'re all set. No more struggling like a seal stuck on an ice floe.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Mirroring of Registries\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/setup-mirror-registry-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/setup-mirror-registry-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Mirroring of Registries step 2\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/setup-mirror-registry-step2-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/setup-mirror-registry-step2-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Podman 5.4\\n\\nA new version of Podman is here. Check out the full details: [Podman 5.4.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.4.0).  \\n:::warning[Breaking change]\\n\\nAs mentioned in the podman 5.4 release notes, support for Mac/Intel is now on a best-effort basis.  \\n:::\\n\\n:::note[Note for 2020 Mac/Intel Users]\\n\\nThere is an open issue where Podman Machine is not booting on certain setups. It is currently under investigation, and you can track the progress here: [Issue #25121](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25121).\\n\\nIn the meantime, here is a quick workaround if 5.4 is not booting:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman machine init --image=docker://quay.io/podman/machine-os:5.2\\n```\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Smoother kind cluster experience\\n\\nEven if you do not have the `kind` CLI installed, Podman Desktop will guide you through the process of installing it when creating a Kind cluster,\\nensuring you can set up your cluster without leaving the workflow. No more diving back to shore for missing tools!\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Smoother kind cluster experience\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/install-kind-cli-create-cluster-dark.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/install-kind-cli-create-cluster-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Kubernetes: Pods and CronJobs\\n\\nSince the last version, we have introduced a dedicated Kubernetes navigation bar. Now, we are making things even clearer:\\n\\n- [Podman Pods](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-pod.1.html) and [Kubernetes Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) are now separate.\\n- A new Pods entry has been added under the Kubernetes section, ensuring you always know which pods you\'re working with.\\n- The Pods view only displays Podman pods.\\n\\nThis means you can now navigate your Kubernetes resources while staying in the Kubernetes section. No more getting lost at sea!\\n\\n[CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) are now available, making them easier to manage than ever before.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Kubernetes: Pods and CronJobs\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/kubernetes-pod-view-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/kubernetes-pod-view-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Kubernetes: new experimental mode\\n\\nUsing this mode, the update of Kubernetes resources is done using health and permission checks.\\nOne bonus now is the ability to easily troubleshoot resource status.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Kubernetes: Pods and CronJobs\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/kube-experimental-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.17/kube-experimental-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\nWe would love your feedback!

from \'react-player\'\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\nimport ThemedImage from \'@theme/ThemedImage\';\\nimport Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\n\\n![banner](img/podman-quadlet/banner.png)\\n\\nContainers are typically deployed in Kubernetes clusters.\\nHowever, for smaller-scale use cases such as on a single-node server or during development, Kubernetes can be overkill.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s a more lightweight solution for running autonomous applications with multiple interacting containers?\\n\\nIn this blog, we\'ll dive into what Quadlets are, their benefits, and how to use them within Podman Desktop.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What Are Quadlets?\\n\\nPodman Quadlets allow you to manage containers declaratively using systemd[^1].\\nSince version 4.4, Podman can create, start, and manage containers (including pulling images, creating volumes, and managing pods) through systemd.\\n\\nQuadlets are simplified configuration files\u2014recognized by their specific extensions,\\nsuch as `*.container`, `*.pod`, or `*.image` that are processed during startup or when you reload the daemon using the `systemctl daemon-reload` command.\\n\\nQuadlets generate the equivalent systemd unit files, streamlining the container management process.\\n\\n[^1]: https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html\\n\\n### Why Use Quadlets?\\n\\n- **Declarative Configuration**: Similar to Compose or Kubernetes manifests, Quadlets allow you to declare what you want to run, simplifying the workload setup.\\n- **Tight System Integration**: Quadlets align with Podman\u2019s philosophy of integrating seamlessly with Linux, leveraging systemd\u2019s process management capabilities.\\n- **Ease of Automation**: Quadlets make it simple to configure containers to start at boot, restart on failure, and more.\\n\\n### Example: A Quadlet File for Nginx\\n\\nBelow is an example of an `nginx.container` Quadlet file, which starts an nginx container at boot:\\n\\n```editorconfig title=\\"~/.config/containers/systemd/nginx.container\\"\\n# nginx.container\\n[Container]\\nContainerName=nginx\\nImage=nginx\\nPublishPort=80:8080\\n\\n[Service]\\nRestart=always\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration ensures the container restarts automatically if stopped, and exposes port 8080.\\n\\n## Using the Podman Quadlet Extension in Podman Desktop\\n\\nManaging Quadlets directly on non-Linux platforms can be challenging due to virtualized environments (e.g., WSL or Hyper-V).\\nFortunately, the Podman Desktop extension Podman Quadlet simplifies this process, enabling you to list, generate, and edit Quadlets visually.\\n\\n### Key Features of the Extension\\n\\n- **Integration with Podlet**: Generates Quadlets from existing Podman objects[^2].\\n- **Quadlet Management UI**: Provides a dedicated interface to list, edit, delete, start, and stop Quadlets.\\n- **Logs Viewer**: Fetches and displays systemd logs using journalctl for troubleshooting.\\n\\n[^2]: https://github.com/containers/podlet\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nIf you already have the latest version of Podman Desktop, you can <a href=\\"podman-desktop:extension/podman-desktop.quadlet\\">**click here to install the Podman Quadlet extension**</a>.\\n\\nAlternatively, navigate to the Extensions page within Podman Desktop to install it.\\n\\n### List Quadlets :clipboard:\\n\\nOn the Podman Quadlet page, you can view all the Quadlets available across your Podman machines. To update the list, click **Refresh**.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Quadlets List\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-quadlet/podman-quadlet-home-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-quadlet/podman-quadlet-home-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n<br/><br/>\\n\\nIn Podman Desktop, you can see that a dedicated icon is used for the containers managed by a Quadlet.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Container Quadlet Icon\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-quadlet/container-icon-quadlet-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-quadlet/container-icon-quadlet-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Generate Quadlets :hammer:\\n\\nTo generate a Quadlet from an existing container, you\u2019ll need to install [Podlet](https://github.com/containers/podlet). The extension simplifies installation.\\n\\nUse one of the following ways to install Podlet:\\n\\n- Go to **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > CLI Tools** and install Podlet using the Podman Quadlet extension.\\n- Download Podlet manually from its [GitHub release page](https://github.com/containers/podlet/releases).\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Podlet Installation\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-quadlet/cli-podlet-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-quadlet/cli-podlet-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n#### Example: Generate a Container Quadlet\\n\\n1. Start a container using Podman:\\n\\n```shell\\npodman run --name nginx-demo -d -p 80:8080 nginx\\n```\\n\\n2. In Podman Desktop, find your container on the Containers page.\\n3.

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\nThis release brings exciting new features and improvements:\\n\\n- **Experimental Features**: a new \\"Experimental\\" section in the Settings provides the list of current experiments, and links to related discussions\\n- **Providers appear in the Status Bar**: Providers are moved from Dashboard to Status Bar, to increase their visibility (experimental feature)\\n- **Prune only untagged images**: Choose to Prune \\"All untagged images\\" or \\"All unused images\\" when Pruning images\\n- **Search in Container\'s Logs**: Possibility to search terms in the logs of containers and pods\\n- **Kubernetes: Monitor current context only**: Only the current context is monitored by default\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Release Details \ud83d\udd0d\\n\\n### Experimental Features\\n\\nPrevious versions of Podman Desktop introduced some experimental features, which were activable from the Settings.\\n\\nIn Podman Desktop v1.16, these Experimental Features are visible in the new \\"Experimental\\" section of the Settings,\\nand dedicated Discussion pages have been created and can be accessed from this section.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Experimental Features Settings\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/experimental-features-settings-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/experimental-features-settings-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Providers appear in the Status Bar\\n\\nIf you activate the Experimental feature \\"Statusbar Providers show Providers\\" (see section above), the providers will\\ndisplay their status in the status bar.\\n\\nSpecifically, providers will display a status if they are providing at least one resource, and indicate with an icon what is the status\\nof their resources: running, or stopped.\\n\\nIn the screenshot below, the Podman provider indicates that the Podman machine is running, and the Kind provider indicates that the Kind cluster is stopped.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Providers statuses\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/provider-status-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/provider-status-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Prune only untagged images\\n\\nWhen clicking the \\"Prune\\" button in the Images List page, it is now possible to select which images you want to be pruned, either all unused images, or all untagged images.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Prune images dialogbox\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/prune-images-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/prune-images-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Search in Container\'s Logs\\n\\nLogs output by containers can be very long, and you might want to search for a specific term on them. Podman Desktop v1.16 now provides this possibility for Podman containers, and for Kubernetes pods.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Search term in Logs\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/logs-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/logs-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Kubernetes: Monitor current context only\\n\\nPrevious versions of Podman Desktop are trying to connect to all Kubernetes contexts found in the kubeconfig file to display how many Pods and Deployments\\nexist in each context.\\n\\nMany users raise that this is problematic. For example, some users have many contexts defined in their kubeconfig, and connecting to all of them can be considered as spamming by clusters.\\n\\nOther users have contexts pointing to clusters hosted by cloud providers, and connecting to these clusters needs a periodic refresh of a token authentication.\\nUsers (or users tools) generally take care of having a fresh token for the current context, but not necesserally for the other ones. The operation of refreshing the token being, for some configurations, designed for CLI tools and not GUI tools, Podman Desktop fails to indicate to the user that this token should be refreshed, and tries infinitely to connect.\\n\\nIn Podman Desktop version 1.16, the number of Pods and Deployments are displayed only for the current context, and the user can select manually for which other contexts these numbers should be displayed.\\n\\n<ThemedImage\\nalt=\\"Kubernetes contexts\\"\\nsources={{\\n    light: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/kube-monitoring-light.png\').default,\\n    dark: require(\'./img/podman-desktop-release-1.16/kube-monitoring-dark.png\').default,\\n  }}\\n/>\\n\\n## Community thank you\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\'d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make Podman Desktop even better.

ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\n![plane](img/cncf-projects/plane.png)\\n\\n# Launching CNCF projects from Podman Desktop\\n\\nPodman Desktop serves as a powerful tool for managing and visualizing cloud-native applications and can interact seamlessly with a range of [CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)](https://www.cncf.io/) projects.\\n\\nIt\'s an accessible platform for developers working with single-container applications, multi-container configurations with Compose files, and complex, distributed applications on Kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n## Key features of Podman Desktop for CNCF projects\\n\\nPodman Desktop brings together three powerful features for managing small to large-scale projects:\\n\\n- **Container Management**: Supports creating, running, and monitoring containers.\\n- **Compose Support**: Allows you to deploy applications defined in [Compose files](https://www.compose-spec.io/). This is particularly useful for managing applications that require multiple services, such as web servers, databases, and caches.\\n- **Kubernetes Integration**: Offers tools to manage multi-node Kubernetes clusters, making it ideal for handling more complex distributed applications that need orchestration across several pods and services. You can setup your own development cluster with Podman Desktop using our [Minikube](/docs/minikube/installing-extension) or [Kind](/docs/kind/installing-extension) extensions.\\n\\n## Minikube\\n\\n[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) is a local Kubernetes development cluster which allows for an easy way to learn and develop for Kubernetes.\\n\\nMinikube can be seamlessly integrated with Podman Desktop, enabling Kubernetes development workflows within Podman\u2019s environment. This is made possible by [installing the Minikube extension](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/minikube/installing-extension), which allows creating, managing, and deploying clusters directly from the Podman Desktop.\\n\\nThe following video provides a complete guide from installation to cluster creation:\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-media/raw/refs/heads/minikube/video/guide.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n## Backstage\\n\\n[Backstage](https://backstage.io/) is an open-source platform for building developer portals, designed by Spotify. It empowers engineering teams to create customized, centralized hubs for managing and documenting their services, applications, and infrastructure. Backstage\u2019s extensible architecture includes features for cataloging software components, organizing documentation, managing cloud resources, and tracking workflows.\\n\\nA popular method for deploying Backstage is through a [Helm chart](https://github.com/backstage/charts). Once deployed, you can view Backstage\u2019s services in the Kubernetes Dashboard to monitor components and ensure proper configuration:\\n\\n![backstage services](img/cncf-projects/backstage.png)\\n\\nYou can also access your deployed Backstage instance by using Podman Desktop\'s port forwarding feature. This feature allows you to securely forward a local port to the Backstage service running on your Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to access the instance from a local browser.\\n\\n![backstage port forward](img/cncf-projects/backstage_port.png)\\n\\n## Dapr\\n\\n[Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/) (Distributed Application Runtime) is an open-source, event-driven runtime designed to help developers build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications that can run seamlessly on cloud or edge environments.\\n\\nDapr abstracts the complexities of distributed systems, offering building blocks for service invocation, state management, publish/subscribe messaging, and resource bindings, which simplify the development of microservices and cloud-native applications.\\n\\nDapr can be deployed in a local environment using Podman by following their [self-hosted podman setup](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/self-hosted/self-hosted-with-podman/).\\n\\nTo initialize Dapr with Podman after installing the Dapr CLI, execute the following command:\\n\\n```console\\n$ dapr init --container-runtime podman\\n```\\n\\nOnce initialized, you can manage and interact with Dapr directly within Podman Desktop:\\n\\n![dapr](img/cncf-projects/dapr.png)\\n\\nAdditionally, Podman Desktop provides a \\"Launch Browser\\" button, allowing quick and convenient access to the Dapr UI for monitoring and management:\\n\\n![dapr browser](img/cncf-projects/dapr_browser.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re managing Kubernetes clusters, harnessing the power of Backstage for developer portals, or deploying microservices with Dapr, Podman Desktop provides a unified environment to streamline your workflows.\\n\\nCheck out the [list of graduate and incubating projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) to discover even more possibilities with Podman Desktop."},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-1.15","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.15","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-12-release-1.15.md","title":"Podman Desktop 1.15 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.15 has been released!","date":"2024-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":8.825,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Axel Stefanini","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/axel7083","imageURL":"https://github.com/axel7083.png","key":"axel7083","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.15 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.15 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-1.15","authors":["axel7083"],"tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.15/banner.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Using CNCF projects with Podman Desktop","permalink":"/blog/cncf-projects"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman AI Lab - For developers to build AI Applications with LLMs running locally","permalink":"/blog/podman-ai-lab-create-ai-app-with-llm-running-locally"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\nimport ThemedImage from \'@theme/ThemedImage\';\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.15 Release! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n![podman-desktop-hero-1.15](/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.15/banner.png)\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.15 is now available!

developers discover examples of applications by using large language models (LLMs), and gives them a framework to create their own AI-based applications and share them with their team.\\n\\nWe will discover, through this article, the different steps to create our first AI application, and to add it to the catalog of recipes of Podman AI Lab.\\n\\n# Our first AI Application\\n\\nFor our first experiment, we will work on a micro-service for the podman-desktop.io website. The micro-service would receive the search terms from the website, and would ask the model to find the best matching pages, before returning the result to the website.\\n\\n![my first app](./img/ai-lab-first-app/00-my-first-ai-app.png)\\n\\n## Preparing Podman Desktop and Podman AI Lab\\n\\nIf you haven\'t done it yet, first [install Podman Desktop and its extension Podman AI Lab](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/ai-lab/installing).\\n\\nTo have a better experience, it is recommended to use the GPU acceleration to serve the model. If you have such a GPU on your machine, you will need to create a Podman machine with the LibKrun provider (on MacOS). More details on [the GPU support for Podman AI Lab](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/09/10/gpu-support-podman-ai-lab).\\n\\nAt the time of writing, the GPU support is still experimental on Podman AI Lab. You will need to enable the option on the Preferences to enable it.\\n\\n![a podman machine running using libkrun](./img/ai-lab-first-app/01-ai-lab-demo-libkrun-machine.png)\\n\\n![GPU support for inference servers preference is enabled](./img/ai-lab-first-app/02-ai-lab-demo-gpu-preference.png)\\n\\n## Testing a prompt with a model\\n\\nPodman AI Lab provides a catalog of open source models that can be used locally. You can go to the `Models > Catalog` page to download the model of your choice. For this article, we will use the `Mistral-7B-instruct` model.\\n\\n![Mistral model is downloaded](./img/ai-lab-first-app/03-ai-lab-demo-mistral-model-downloaded.png)\\n\\nOnce a model is downloaded, we can test and interact with this model to try to find the best prompt for our application. For chat models, Podman AI Lab provides a `Playground`, so we can test different prompts and validate that the responses of the model are adequate.\\n\\nLet\'s start a new playground (from the `Models > Playgrounds` menu), and send our first prompt:\\n\\n```text\\nGive me a list of pages in the website podman-desktop.io related to \\"build an image\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe model should reply with some list of pages, in a human-readable form (see the screenshot below, for the response we received).\\n\\n![a first prompt with human-readable output](./img/ai-lab-first-app/04-ai-lab-demo-prompt-1.png)\\n\\nThe problem is that the response is in human-readable form, but we don\'t want the API to return this response as is. We want to have the name and the url of the pages, and send them to the website, so the website can display these pages with its preferred format.\\n\\nFor this, we can try to ask the model to reply with a structured response, with the following prompt:\\n\\n```text\\nGive me a list of pages in the website podman-desktop.io related to \\"build an image\\" as JSON output as an array of objects with 2 fields name and url\\n```\\n\\nThis time, we received a response in JSON format, which is more suitable for our needs.\\n\\n![a prompt with structured output](./img/ai-lab-first-app/05-ai-lab-demo-prompt-json.png)\\n\\nWe don\'t expect the user to ask such a precise question, and we would prefer to send to the model the exact question of the user, without modifying it in real time. To achieve this, chat models provide a system prompt feature. The system prompt can be defined at the beginning of the chat session.\\n\\nPodman AI Lab supports this feature, let\'s restart a Playground session with the following system prompt:\\n\\n```text\\nGive me a list of pages in the website podman-desktop.io related to the request as JSON output as an array of objects with 2 fields name and url\\n```\\n\\nThen, send the prompt `build an image`, to simulate a realistic search input of a user.\\n\\nWe can see in the screenshot below that the model still returns a response suitable for our use case.\\n\\n![a session with a system prompt](./img/ai-lab-first-app/06-ai-lab-demo-system-prompt.png)\\n\\n> Please note that this section was not a course on writing the best prompt, I\'m sure you will find much more efficient prompts for this purpose. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how you can iterate with Podman AI Lab to refine the prompts you want to use for your application.\\n\\n## Testing a recipe\\n\\nNow that we have a suitable prompt to use for our application, it is time to start our application itself.\\n\\nMany developers prefer to have a working example of application to start with, and Podman AI Lab provides such examples with a catalog of recipes, visible in the page `AI Apps > Recipe Catalog`.\\n\\nLet\'s select the Chatbot recipe (`More details` link on the Chatbot card), and start it with the Mistral model (by pressing the `Start` button and filling the form).\\n\\nOnce the application is started, we can access the list of running apps in the `AI Apps > Running` page, and we can access the app\'s UI by clicking on the `Open AI App` link.\\n\\nWe can test again by typing our prompt (not the one with a system prompt, as the recipe does not support providing a system prompt), and see that the response is very similar to the one received from the playground.\\n\\n![a session on the Chatbot recipe](./img/ai-lab-first-app/07-ai-lab-demo-recipe-session.png)\\n\\nBack to the recipe\'s details page, we can access the sources of the recipe by clicking on the `Open in VSCode` button, the respository\'s link or the link `Local clone`.\\n\\n### Structure of a recipe\\n\\nThe entrypoint of a recipe is the file `ai-lab.yaml` present in the repository of the recipe.\\n\\nLet\'s examine the content of this file (the syntax of the file is specified in [this documentation](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab/blob/main/PACKAGING-GUIDE.md#recipe-configuration-file)) for the chatbot example.\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: v1.0\\napplication:\\n  type: language\\n  name: ChatBot_Streamlit\\n  description: Chat with a model service in a web frontend.\\n  containers:\\n    - name: llamacpp-server\\n      contextdir: ../../../model_servers/llamacpp_python\\n      containerfile: ./base/Containerfile\\n      model-service: true\\n      backend:\\n        - llama-cpp\\n      arch:\\n        - arm64\\n        - amd64\\n      ports:\\n        - 8001\\n      image: quay.io/ai-lab/llamacpp_python:latest\\n    - name: streamlit-chat-app\\n      contextdir: app\\n      containerfile: Containerfile\\n      arch:\\n        - arm64\\n        - amd64\\n      ports:\\n        - 8501\\n      image: quay.io/ai-lab/chatbot:latest\\n```\\n\\nThe file defines two containers, one for the inference server and one for the application itself.\\n\\nThe first container, for the inference server, is generic and can be reused for any app using a chat model.\\n\\nThe second one is the one we are particularly interested in. It defines how the container\'s image for the application is built. It points to the Containerfile used to build the image, on which we can find the source code for the app: in the `app/chatbot_ui.py` file.\\n\\nLooking at the Python source file, we can see that the application uses the `streamlit` framework for the UI part, and the `langchain` framework for discussing with the model.\\n\\nWe can adapt this source code, by replacing the UI part with a framework to make the app a REST service, and keep the `langchain` part.\\n\\nAn interesting part of the source code is that the recipe does not expose to the user the system prompt, but defines one internally (`You are world class technical advisor`):\\n\\n```python\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\\"system\\", \\"You are world class technical advisor.\\"),\\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\\"history\\"),\\n    (\\"user\\", \\"{input}\\")\\n])\\n```\\n\\nThis is exactly what we want to do in our application, we will be able to indicate here the system prompt we have found earlier.\\n\\n## Creating our own app\\n\\nAdapting the source code for the purpose of our application is out of the scope of this article, let\'s see the result in [our app repository](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo/blob/main/ai-lab-demo/recipe/app/service.py).\\n\\nAs discussed in the previous section, we have replaced the `streamlit` part with the `flask` framework to create a REST API with two endpoints: one for the health check on `/` necessary for Podman AI Lab, and another one on `/query`, which will be the endpoint on which the micro-service\'s user will send requests.\\n\\nWe have also indicated our own system prompt:\\n\\n```python\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\\"system\\", \\"\\"\\"\\n        reply in JSON format with an array of objects with 2 fields name and url\\n        (and with no more text than the JSON output),\\n        with a list of pages in the website https://www.podman-desktop.io related to my query\\n    \\"\\"\\"),\\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\\"history\\"),\\n    (\\"user\\", \\"{input}\\")\\n])\\n```\\n\\n## Testing my own app locally\\n\\nTo iterate during the development of our app, we can test our app locally in our host system, while using the model served by Podman AI Lab. For this, we need to start a new model service from the page `Models > Services`, by clicking the `New Model Service`, then choosing the appropriate model (`Mistral-7B-instruct` in our case), and specifying a port number (let\'s say 56625).\\n\\n![a running inference server with Mistral model](./img/ai-lab-first-app/08-ai-lab-demo-inference-server.png)\\n\\nThen, we can run our app, by specifying through the `MODEL_ENDPOINT` environment variable how to access the model service.\\n\\n![my app running locally](./img/ai-lab-first-app/09-ai-lab-demo-my-app-local.png)\\n\\nFinally, we can send a request to this app running locally, and listening in the port 5000, and we can check in the screenshot below that the response is, as expected, a list of pages (name and url) in JSON format:\\n\\n![a request to the micro-service](./img/ai-lab-first-app/10-ai-lab-demo-my-app-http-request.png)\\n\\n## Creating a recipe\\n\\nThe last step is to add this application to the Podman AI Lab recipe catalog.\\n\\nPodman AI Lab provides a way for a user to extend the provided catalog with its own recipes. This can be done by adding a file in a specific directory, as described [in this documentation](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-providing-a-custom-catalog).\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0\\",\\n  \\"recipes\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"id\\": \\"search-podman-desktop-io\\",\\n      \\"description\\": \\"Search on Podman-desktop.io website\\",\\n      \\"name\\": \\"Search Podman-desktop.io\\",\\n      \\"repository\\": \\"https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo\\",\\n      \\"ref\\": \\"main\\",\\n      \\"icon\\": \\"natural-language-processing\\",\\n      \\"categories\\": [\\"natural-language-processing\\"],\\n      \\"basedir\\": \\"ai-lab-demo/recipe\\",\\n      \\"readme\\": \\"\\",\\n      \\"recommended\\": [\\"hf.TheBloke.mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M\\"],\\n      \\"backend\\": \\"llama-cpp\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy creating the file `$HOME/.local/share/containers/podman-desktop/extensions-storage/redhat.ai-lab/user-catalog.json` with the content above, you should now be able to see a new recipe `Search Podman-desktop.io` in the recipe catalog of Podman AI Lab, and run it as any other recipe. And, of course, you can share this file with your colleagues to share with them your latest experiment."},{"id":"/2024/11/14/podman-desktop-cncf","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/14/podman-desktop-cncf","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-14-podman-desktop-cncf.md","title":"Podman Desktop + CNCF - Community Driven Move","description":"Today, we\'re thrilled to announce our application for Podman Desktop to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox project.","date":"2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"inline":true,"label":"podman","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman"},{"inline":true,"label":"cncf","permalink":"/blog/tags/cncf"},{"inline":true,"label":"container","permalink":"/blog/tags/container"}],"readingTime":4.785,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Eisele","title":"Product Marketing","url":"https://github.com/myfear","imageURL":"https://github.com/myfear.png","key":"meisele","page":null},{"name":"Stevan Le Meur","title":"Product Manager","url":"https://github.com/slemeur","imageURL":"https://github.com/slemeur.png","key":"slemeur","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Desktop + CNCF - Community Driven Move","description":"Today, we\'re thrilled to announce our application for Podman Desktop to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox project.","authors":["meisele","slemeur"],"tags":["podman-desktop","podman","cncf","container"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Podman AI Lab - For developers to build AI Applications with LLMs running locally","permalink":"/blog/podman-ai-lab-create-ai-app-with-llm-running-locally"},"nextItem":{"title":"Creating a MicroShift bootable image with Podman Desktop","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/08/bootc-microshift"}},"content":"import Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\n\\n![banner](img/podman-desktop-cncf/cncf_rocket.png)\\n\\nToday, we\'re thrilled to announce our application for Podman Desktop to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox project.This is a huge milestone for our project and our community, and we\'re incredibly excited for what the future holds.\\n\\n### About Podman Desktop\\n\\nPodman Desktop builds upon the innovations brought by Podman, offering a powerful yet user-friendly environment for containerized development.

Navigate to the directory containing your `disk.raw` file:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ cd ~/output\\n```\\n\\n4. Run the `qemu` command:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ qemu-system-x86_64 \\\\\\n    -m 8G \\\\\\n    -cpu Broadwell-v4 \\\\\\n    -nographic \\\\\\n    -netdev user,id=mynet0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \\\\\\n    -device e1000,netdev=mynet0 \\\\\\n    -snapshot disk.raw\\n```\\n\\n4. Verify the connection:\\n\\nWith the above `qemu` command, a port has now been opened locally at :2222 to SSH forward to the bootable image. You can now access your virtual machine by doing the following:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ ssh redhat@localhost -p 2222\\n```\\n\\n</TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n## Configuring and verifying MicroShift\\n\\nAfter you boot your virtual machine, you can now configure MicroShift as well as verify the connection.\\n\\n### Copying over the OpenShift pull secret\\n\\nBefore proceeding with verifying OpenShift, the OpenShift pull secret must be copied over so that MicroShift can download Red Hat registry-authenticated container images.\\n\\nBelow we will copy the OpenShift secret you had previously downloaded to the virtual machine.\\n\\n1. Download your [OpenShift pull secret](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) which is downloaded as `pull-secret.txt`\\n\\n2. Use `scp` to copy over to the virtual machine:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ scp -P 2222 pull-secret.txt redhat@localhost:~/\\n```\\n\\n3. SSH into the VM:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ ssh redhat@localhost -p 2222\\n```\\n\\n4. Move the secret to `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret`:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo mv pull-secret.txt /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret\\n```\\n\\n5. Restart the `microshift` service:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo systemctl restart microshift\\n```\\n\\n### Listing pods\\n\\nBelow we will SSH into the virtual machine and confirm that MicroShift is deploying Pods correctly:\\n\\n1. SSH into the VM:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ ssh redhat@localhost -p 2222\\n```\\n\\n2. Copy the generated `kubeconfig` file to `~/.kube/config`:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ mkdir -p ~/.kube\\n$ sudo cp /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config\\n$ sudo chown redhat ~/.kube/config\\n```\\n\\n3. Verify Pods are running by using `oc` or `kubectl`:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl get pods -A\\nNAMESPACE                  NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkube-system                csi-snapshot-controller-856bb8b9bc-9n7lj   1/1     Running   1          3d23h\\nkube-system                csi-snapshot-webhook-7c64d4d4d7-98v6l      1/1     Running   1          3d23h\\nopenshift-dns              dns-default-n2td4                          2/2     Running   2          3d23h\\nopenshift-dns              node-resolver-7cslg                        1/1     Running   1          3d23h\\nopenshift-ingress          router-default-7cbc67954b-nqqc6            1/1     Running   1          3d23h\\nopenshift-ovn-kubernetes   ovnkube-master-zcqw5                       4/4     Running   5          3d23h\\nopenshift-ovn-kubernetes   ovnkube-node-crnn9                         1/1     Running   2          3d23h\\nopenshift-service-ca       service-ca-6799f567-k7lsc                  1/1     Running   1          3d23h\\n```\\n\\n### Using Podman Desktop to verify MicroShift\\n\\nAlternatively, you can copy the MicroShift configuration file to your local machine and test it remotely on Podman Desktop.\\n\\n1. On your local machine, create the `.kube` directory if it does not exist already:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ mkdir ~/.kube\\n```\\n\\n2. Copy the remote `kubeconfig` file to a local configuration file:\\n\\nWithin MicroShift, a `kubeconfig` file is automatically created at `/var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig`.\\n\\nCopy the file over to your local system:\\n\\n```sh\\nscp -P 2222 redhat@localhost:/var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig ~/config\\n```\\n\\nIf you already have a `~/.kube/config`, copy the contents of `config` to the `~/.kube/config` file.\\n\\n3. Use Podman Desktop to verify the MicroShift cluster:\\n\\nPodman Desktop will automatically detect your `.kube/config` file.\\n\\nNote: You may need to modify your `.kube/config` file to reflect the correct domain or IP address of your cluster.\\n\\n![cluster](img/bootc-microshift/cluster.png)\\n\\n### Storage configuration\\n\\nBy default, storage configuration [requires an LVM partition](https://github.com/openshift/microshift/blob/main/docs/contributor/storage/default_csi_plugin.md#default-volume-group) and LVMS storage manager will not be deployed. This is due to a limitation when building a RAW image. An alternative non-local storage solution is required to use OpenShift artifacts with storage capabilities. The feature to add LVM support is tracked in this [pull request](https://github.com/osbuild/images/pull/926).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis tutorial provided a step-by-step guide on deploying a bootable MicroShift image using Podman Desktop and the BootC extension. By leveraging tools such as BootC and Podman, we\'ve streamlined the process of creating a lightweight, yet fully functional, OpenShift environment suitable for single-node edge computing scenarios.\\n\\nThank you for following along, and happy deploying!"},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-1.14","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.14","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-31-release-1.14.md","title":"Podman Desktop 1.14 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.14 has been released!","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":9.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ev\u017een Gasta","title":"Associate Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/gastoner","imageURL":"https://github.com/gastoner.png","key":"gastoner","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.14 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.14 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-1.14","authors":["gastoner"],"tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"\x3c!-- This image link is used for social media previews / thumbnails.

Release","permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.13"}},"content":"![programming](img/creating-an-extension/programming.png)\\n\\n# How to create your first extension\\n\\nExtensions are a powerful tool to customize and extend the functionality of Podman Desktop. Whether you want to add new container management features, streamline current workflows, or create custom UI elements specific to your tech stack, building extensions allows you to tailor the Podman Desktop experience to your specific needs.\\n\\nIn this guide, we\'ll introduce how you can build your own Podman Desktop extension, with links to detailed documentation that covers each part of the process.\\n\\n## Introduction to extensions\\n\\nExtensions are abundant in Podman Desktop and can be found in the **Extensions -> Catalog** section.\\n\\n![extension catalog](img/podman-desktop-release-1.10/extension-catalog.png)\\n\\nEach extension expands on Podman Desktop, such as providing [Kubernetes development clusters with Minikube](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-minikube) or even [analyzing your image layers](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-layers-explorer).\\n\\nBelow is an example of the [layers explorer extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-layers-explorer) and how it integrates into Podman Desktop:\\n\\n![layers_explorer](img/creating-an-extension/layers_explorer.png)\\n\\n## Getting started with your project\\n\\nThe first step in creating your extension is setting up the project environment. To learn how to configure the project and add basic components, check out the **[Templates for creating an extension](/docs/extensions/templates)** guide, which walks you through initializing your project from an official template.\\n\\n## Adding UI components\\n\\nOne of the most common tasks when creating an extension is adding a user interface. Whether it\u2019s adding buttons, panels, or icons, UI components help make your extension more interactive and accessible. Adding a UI component is totally optional and an extension can be ran without UI components. Learn more about this in the **[Adding UI components](/docs/extensions/developing/adding-ui-components)** documentation, where you\u2019ll find instructions on creating and integrating components into the application\u2019s UI.\\n\\n### Working with icons\\n\\nIcons are a great way to make your extension more visually unique. You can learn how to add and style custom icons by following the **[Adding icons](/docs/extensions/developing/adding-icons)** documentation.\\n\\nBelow is an example of how the [bootc extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-bootc) added icons to the image list within Podman Desktop:\\n\\n![icons](img/creating-an-extension/icons.png)\\n\\n### Menus and navigation\\n\\nExtensions often integrate with existing menus and navigation to offer users easy access to new commands and features. If you want to add items to the context menu, explore the **[Menu configuration](/docs/extensions/developing/menu)** documentation, which explains how to add commands to menus and control when they are displayed using When Clauses.\\n\\nBelow is an example of how the [bootc extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-bootc) added a new menu command to image list:\\n\\n![menus](img/creating-an-extension/menus.png)\\n\\n## Adding and configuring commands\\n\\nCommands are the backbone of most extensions, allowing users to interact with the application and trigger specific actions.\\n\\nIf you need to define and register custom commands, the **[Commands](/docs/extensions/developing/commands)** guide will show you how to create commands that respond to user actions or input, and tie them into your extension\u2019s workflow.\\n\\nYou can also configure these commands to appear in different contexts. Check out the **[When clause Contexts](/docs/extensions/developing/when-clause-context)** documentation to learn more about restricting commands to specific scenarios.\\n\\nCommands are heavily influenced by [VS Code commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/command) and can be configured similarly. See our [commands guide](/docs/extensions/developing/commands) for more information.\\n\\n## Setting up onboarding workflows\\n\\nCreating a smooth onboarding experience is essential to help users get started with your extension. This includes steps for CLI binary installations or other initial setup values.\\n\\nYou can provide guidance, tutorials, or initial setup steps using the **[Onboarding workflow](/docs/extensions/developing/onboarding-workflow)** guide.\\n\\nBelow is an example of how the [built-in compose extension](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/tree/main/extensions/compose) adds onboarding for the compose CLI binary installation:\\n\\n![compose](img/creating-an-extension/compose.png)\\n\\n## Configuration settings\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve built your components and commands, you may want to setup configuration settings for advanced usage of your extension.\\n\\nThe **[Configuration](/docs/extensions/developing/config)** documentation outlines the configuration file structure and how to link everything together to use user-specific values.\\n\\n## Publishing your extension\\n\\nPublishing enables users to install your extension, you can compile your extension into a container image for users to easily consume. Follow the **[Publishing](/docs/extensions/publish)** guide to learn how to distribute your extension.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCreating an extension opens up endless possibilities to customize Podman Desktop to your specific needs.\\n\\nIt is also easy to package and publish your extension for others to use.\\n\\nHave fun exploring our documentation on how to create an extension and happy coding!"},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-1.13","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.13","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-07-release-1.13.md","title":"Podman Desktop 1.13 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.13 has been released!","date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"podman","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman"}],"readingTime":5.465,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sonia Sandler","title":"Associate Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/SoniaSandler","imageURL":"https://github.com/SoniaSandler.png","key":"SoniaSandler","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.13 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.13 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-1.13","authors":"SoniaSandler","tags":["podman-desktop","release","podman"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.13/banner.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introduction to Podman Desktop extensions","permalink":"/blog/extensions-introduction"},"nextItem":{"title":"Build your Kubernetes application with Podman Desktop","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/05/kubernetes-blog"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.13 Release! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n![podman-desktop-hero-1.13](img/podman-desktop-release-1.13/banner.png)\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.13 is now available.

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\nThis release includes:\\n\\n- **Podman remote**: We now support remote Podman setups! Manage your remote Podman machines all within the UI.\\n- **macOS GPU support**: Container GPU access on macOS is now available. [`libkrun`](https://github.com/containers/libkrun) is now a selectable provider type to allow GPU passthrough enablement.\\n- **Windows GPU support**: Want to try out Windows GPU support too? Podman already supports it, but we are now showcasing it in our [AI Lab extension](https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab)\\n- **Podman 5.2.0**: This new version of Podman provides GPU access for macOS, as well as a host of [new features](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.2.0).\\n- **Light mode out of experimental**: Our light mode has been well-received, and we have now marked it as non-experimental! Enjoy the new theme.\\n- **Kubernetes features**: ConfigMaps, Secrets and multi-file Kubernetes YAML applying have now been added to our Kubernetes dashboard.\\n- **Improved font consistency**: You\'ll notice a big difference in consistency this release, as we updated all font sizes throughout Podman Desktop.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### Podman remote\\n\\nWe now support remote Podman sessions! Use Podman Desktop to interact with remote instances over SSH. This allows both container and image management.\\n\\nYou can enable this in the **Preferences** section of Podman Desktop:\\n\\n![remote](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/remote.png)\\n\\nTo set up access to a remote machine, follow the official [Podman remote-client tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/remote_client.md).\\n\\n### macOS GPU support\\n\\nGPU support is now available for macOS users!\\n\\nThis seamless setup can be enabled during Podman Machine creation by selecting the provider type:\\n\\n![libkrun](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/libkrun.png)\\n\\nAfter enablement, you can test that the GPU has been supported by running a custom container with `--device /dev/dri` passed through:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ podman run --rm -it --device /dev/dri --name gpu-info quay.io/slopezpa/fedora-vgpu vulkaninfo | grep \\"GPU\\"\\n```\\n\\nWhich will output information regarding your GPU:\\n\\n```sh\\n\\n  GPU id = 0 (Virtio-GPU Venus (Apple M1 Pro))\\n  GPU id = 1 (llvmpipe (LLVM 17.0.6, 128 bits))\\nGPU0:\\n deviceType        = PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU\\n deviceName        = Virtio-GPU Venus (Apple M1 Pro)\\nGPU1:\\n```\\n\\nStay tuned as we continue to improve and write documentation on GPU support.\\n\\nThe most practical way to try these new features out is by installing [AI Lab (>1.2.3)](https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab) and seeing the improved speed.\\n\\nThis can be done by following the below steps:\\n\\n1. **Update to the latest Podman AI Lab extension (v1.2.3)** from the Extensions Catalog on Podman Desktop.\\n2. Create a new Podman Machine with `libkrun` enabled (see above instructions).\\n3. Enable GPU support within Podman AI Lab extension:\\n\\n![ai_lab](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/ai_lab.png)\\n\\n4. Start an inference server / playground environment and enjoy the benefits of accelerated GPU support!\\n\\n### Windows GPU support\\n\\nWindows GPU support has been integrated into Podman for a while, however our associated extensions have now been utilizing this great feature! Such as in [AI Lab](https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab).\\n\\nTo showcase this awesome feature, this can be done by following the below steps:\\n\\n1. **Update to the latest Podman AI Lab extension** from the Extensions Catalog on Podman Desktop.\\n2. Create a Podman Machine with WSL enabled.\\n3. Enable GPU support within the Podman AI Lab Extension:\\n\\n![ai_lab](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/ai_lab.png)\\n\\n4. Start an inference server / playground environment and enjoy the benefits of accelerated GPU support!\\n\\n### Light mode out of experimental\\n\\nWe\'ve made excellent progress in light mode and we have now marked it out of non-experimental! If you have not already tried it yet, this can be enabled within the interface here:\\n\\n![light mode](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/light_mode.png)\\n\\n### Kubernetes features\\n\\nWith this release, you can now view ConfigMaps as well as Secrets:\\n\\n![configmaps secrets](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/configmaps_secrets.png)\\n\\nYou also have the ability to now select multiple files when applying your Kubernetes YAML.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped make \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop even better.

You can now enjoy a brighter interface by toggling the light mode option in the **<icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" />Settings > Preferences** section. Thank you for your patience as we continue to implement light mode for better accessibility! Please note, this feature is currently experimental as we continue to optimize the rest of Podman Desktop for this new mode.\\n\\n![Podman-desktop-1-11-hero](img/podman-desktop-release-1.11/light_mode.png)\\n\\n### macOS Rosetta Support for Apple Silicon\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.11 proudly introduces support for macOS Rosetta, facilitating seamless integration with Apple Silicon. This update, part of Podman 5.1, allows users to enable or disable Rosetta support directly through the Podman Settings. With this enhancement, running AMD64 image builds or containers achieves speeds that are nearly identical to those experienced on ARM64 architectures. For more details on the implementation, visit the [GitHub podman pull request](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/21670).\\n\\n### Kubernetes Enhancements\\n\\nIn our latest release, we\'ve enhanced Kubernetes functionality by adding node and volume listings. This update aims to improve your Kubernetes management experience within Podman Desktop.\\n\\n![kubernetes enhancements](img/podman-desktop-release-1.11/nodes.png)\\n\\n![kubernetes enhancements](img/podman-desktop-release-1.11/pvc.png)\\n\\n### User Interface Improvements\\n\\nTake a moment to appreciate the upgraded user interface of Podman Desktop. You\'ll find that the container listing section, among others, has received significant enhancements, elevating your overall user experience.\\n\\n### Enhanced Manifest Support\\n\\nWe\'ve made strides in how we handle manifest images. Multi-arch images are now grouped under the manifest, simplifying the process and enhancing efficiency.\\n\\n![manifests](img/podman-desktop-release-1.11/manifest.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable

A big thank you \ud83d\ude4f to everyone\\nwho has helped get us to this number - especially those who have opened issues or PRs and contributed\\nto this success!\\n\\nLooking forward to the next million! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n### Extension Catalog\\n\\nTo make it easier to access extensions we added an item to the main navigation and completely revamped\\nthe Extensions page. You can now see and control all your Podman Desktop and Docker Desktop extensions\\nin a single place. If you want to view more details, click on an extension to see the expanded readme.\\n\\n![extensions](img/podman-desktop-release-1.10/extensions.png)\\n\\nWith the growing number of extensions available we\'ve also introduced a catalog to make it easy to find\\nand install them. Check the catalog regularly as we hear there are some exciting new extensions sailing in!\\n\\n![extension catalog](img/podman-desktop-release-1.10/extension-catalog.png)\\n\\n### Podman v5 (5.0.2)\\n\\nNow that we\'ve had some experience and time to test our migration tools, we\'re glad to make Podman v5 a\\nrecommended upgrade for all users. Podman Desktop will help ensure you don\'t lose any data during the\\nmigration. In particular macOS users will see a performance boost as we\'ve switched to the native\\nApple Hypervisor.\\n\\nFind out more details in the blog announcement for \ud83e\uddad Podman version 5 [here](https://blog.podman.io/2024/03/podman-5-0-has-been-released/).\\n\\n### Multi-platform Builds\\n\\nSticking to one platform keeping you down? Building on the work we did in a recent release to allow building\\nimages for other platforms, you can now select multiple platforms at once. When you do this we will\\nautomatically switch to building an image for each selected platform and then creating a multi-platform\\nmanifest to package them all together.\\n\\n![multi-platform builds](img/podman-desktop-release-1.10/multi-platform-builds.png)\\n\\nWe still have work to do to allow seamlessly working with images or manifests, so stay tuned for more.\\n\\n### Extension API Improvements\\n\\nWe\'ve added support for manifests (multi-arch images) to the extension API to give upcoming extensions\\nmore capabilites and even better integration into \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop:\\n\\n- feat: add inspectManifest API endpoint [#6812](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6812)\\n- feat: add createManifest API [#6630](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6630)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\nWe\'ve added lots of features this release, here are some other highlights:\\n\\n- feat: add quick install of extensions providing authentication [#6936](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6936)\\n- feat: add alias for registry entries [#6839](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6839)\\n- feat: make recommendation have publishDate property [#6912](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6912)\\n- feat: suggest extensions if building or pulling from some registries report errors [#6891](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6891)\\n- feat: switch to using libpodapi for listImages [#6736](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6736)\\n- feat: add navigateTo resources and edit container connection [#6733](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6733)\\n- feat: adding dashboard extension banner [#6708](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6708)\\n- feat: adding internal logic to manage recommended extensions based on featured extensions [#6681](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6681)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\nWe squashed a lot of bugs this release, including the following:\\n\\n- fix: default to rootful mode if unspecified [#6968](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6968)\\n- fix: boolean values should be true and not \'on\' using forms [#6967](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6967)\\n- fix: handle deletion of all Docker Desktop extensions [#6964](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6964)\\n- fix: skip existing installed extensions when installing a pack [#6914](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6914)\\n- fix: hide cpu, memory, size sliders on WSL [#6878](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6878)\\n- fix: container details image link [#6805](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6805)\\n- fix: provider card layout [#6797](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6797)\\n- fix: kubectl-cli update error [#6759](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6759)\\n- fix: make flatpak metadata compliant with flathub [#6635](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6635)\\n- fix: airgap mode and default for podman v5 [#6633](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6633)\\n- fix: hide restart action for kubernetes pods [#6620](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6620)\\n- fix: increase default timeout for extension activation [#7053](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/7053)\\n- fix: use podman machine inspect to know if machine is rootful [#7024](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/7024)\\n- fix: edit button should be visible during started and stopped [#7045](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/7045)\\n- fix: fix dashboard UI [#7006](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/7006)\\n- fix: handle ids with spaces for extensions [#6965](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6965)\\n- fix: remove request for login after getting session programmatically [#6665](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6665)\\n- fix: LoadingIconButton consider failed state [#6997](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6997)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nAlong with this new version of \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop the documentation has had the following improvement:\\n\\n- docs: add compose troubleshooting doc related to authentication [#6928](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6928)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped make \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop even better.

[see blog post introducing Podman v5](https://blog.podman.io/2024/03/podman-5-0-has-been-released/)\\n\\nOn macOS there are performance enhancements as Apple Hypervisor is used instead of QEMU for the Podman machine. Also expect better performance on the file sharing.\\n\\nThat said, Podman machine version 5 is introducing changes that are not compliant with podman machine version 4.\\n\\nThis is why we\'re rolling out Podman version 5 by default only to new users to improve the migration from Podman Desktop side.\\n\\nFor Podman version 4 users, Podman version 5 is accessible using an [experimental flag](#enabling-experimental-flag).\\n\\nMoving to Podman v5 implies to optionally save images and then delete previous machines and create a new one.\\n\\n#### Important steps before updating\\n\\nPrioritize data backup by using the save feature in the `Image Lists` section. This feature allows you to back up your images and restore them once you have a new Podman machine.\\n\\nWhen prompted to update, confirm to remove all existing data from your machines.\\n\\nFor more details on the save/load feature, refer to [the save/load images section of the release notes](#saveload-images-or-exportimport-containers).\\n\\n![v5 update](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-update-to-v5.png)\\n\\n#### Enabling experimental flag\\n\\nAre you using Podman 4.x but eager to migrate? Enable the Podman `v5` experimental flag in `Settings > Preferences > Extension: Podman`.\\n\\nThis will make the Upgrade option available on the Dashboard.\\n\\n![v5 experimental flag](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/experimental-podman-5.png)\\n\\n#### Onboarding notification for Podman version 5\\n\\nIf you have previously installed Podman version 5 and Podman Desktop detects some invalid Podman machines, you\'ll see a notification on the dashboard to clean up old machines.\\n\\n![Onboarding Notification](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-require-onboarding-1.png)\\n\\n![Remove previous Podman machines](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-require-onboarding-2.png)\\n\\n### Podman 4.9.4\\n\\nIf you want to stay on Podman v4.x, there is a new update for some bugs including a CVE/security issue.\\n\\n### Save/Load Images or Export/Import Containers\\n\\nPodman 5 is not able to read 4.x machines, so before updating you\'ll need to backup images that you need to keep. You don\'t need to backup images that are available on remote registries or transient.\\n\\n#### Save/Load Images\\n\\n\ud83e\uddad Use Podman Desktop to save images and load them again.\\n\\n![Select images to save](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-save-1.png)\\n\\n![Save images](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-save-2.png)\\n\\nLoad images using the Load button from the image list.\\n\\n![Select images to load](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-load-1.png)\\n\\n![Load images](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-load-2.png)\\n\\n#### Save/Load Containers\\n\\n\ud83e\uddad Export filesystem of containers and import them.\\n\\n![Select containers to export](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-export-1.png)\\n\\n![Export containers](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-export-2.png)\\n\\nImport containers using the Load button from the image list.\\n\\n![Select files to import](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-import-1.png)\\n\\n![Import images](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-import-2.png)\\n\\n**_NOTE:_** Exporting the filesystem of containers only exports the content of the filesystem. Importing will result in a container without any commands, so this might not be what you expect.\\nPlease prioritize the usage of image saving/loading over container export/import.\\n\\n### Terminal in Kubernetes Pods\\n\\nIn the previous release we introduced several new features in Kubernetes, but one notable addition was missing. With the 1.9 release, we\'re excited to announce that you can now connect to the terminal of a pod.\\n\\n- Terminal Connectivity: Users can now establish a direct connection to the terminal of a pod, enhancing the management and troubleshooting capabilities within Kubernetes environments.\\n- Container Toggle: When a pod contains multiple containers, you can easily toggle between them to access the terminal of the desired container.\\n\\nHow to access to the Terminal:\\n\\nNavigate to the pod details in Podman Desktop and select the \\"Terminal\\" Tab..\\n\\nIf the pod contains multiple containers, utilize the toggle feature to select the container whose terminal you wish to connect to.\\n\\nOnce connected, you can interact with the terminal to perform various tasks such as debugging, log monitoring, or executing commands within the container environment.\\n\\n![Connect Terminal to a Pod](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/terminal-pod.png)\\n\\n### Extension API Improvements\\n\\nWe continued spent a lot of time adding new extension API to give upcoming extensions\\nmore capabilites and even better integration into \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop:\\n\\n- feat: add navigateToAuthentication method to navigation API [6603](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6603)\\n- feat: add secrets handling to extensionContext in extension api [6423](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6423)\\n- feat: add sign in button for auth providers w/ the only auth session request [6446](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6446)\\n- feat: support for webview reveal [6546](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6546)\\n\\nAlso we published a test framework to test extensions in separate repositories\\n\\n- feat: publish ui components and test component as part of the release [6580](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6580)\\n\\nMore info on [https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/tests/playwright/README.md](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/tests/playwright/README.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\nWe\'ve added over 20 features this release, here are some other highlights:\\n\\n- feat: terminate wsl machines before removing conf files when fixing update [#6596](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6596)\\n- feat: update experimental v5 of podman to v5.0.1 [#6589](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6589)\\n- feat: detect podman v4 machines not compliant with the new format of v5 [#6570](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6570)\\n- feat: detect podman v4 qemu machines after update and delete them [#6565](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6565)\\n- feat: update to podman v4.9.4 [#6564](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6564)\\n- feat: default to podman v5 for new users [#6548](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6548)\\n- feat: import containers images [#6492](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6492)\\n- feat: open terminal in the running container [#5975](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5975)\\n- feat: add experimental flag to install podman v5 [#6476](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6476)\\n- feat: add export container [#6468](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6468)\\n- feat: allow to revive a Uri object when passing it frontend -

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### Podman 4.9.3\\n\\n\ud83e\uddad Podman 4.9.3 includes key fixes for stability and reliability issues reported by our users - especially\\nif you are using Apple silicon architecture. If you\'ve been floundering we highly recommend updating!\\n\\n### Kubernetes Explorer\\n\\nProgressively introduced in past releases as an experimental feature, we\'re ready to expand\\nour capabilities to help developers transition from containers to Kubernetes. In this release we\\nare introducing a new set of features that enable the developers to work with more Kubernetes\\nresources, offering more granular and interactive control over your applications.\\n\\nNow available in \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop is a new Kubernetes Explorer with the ability to work with\\nDeployments, Services, Ingresses, and Routes, in addition to the existing support for Pods.\\nFor each of those resources, \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop provides real-time information about the status of\\nresources on the cluster. From the top right of this overview page you can also click Apply YAML\\nto create or update resources on the cluster similar to \'kubectl apply -f\', and see the current\\nconnection status.\\n\\n![Deployments Overview](img/podman-desktop-release-1.8/deployments.png)\\n\\nJust like with local containers or images, you can click for more\\ndetails on Summary, Inspect, and Kube (YAML) pages.\\n\\n![Deployment Summary](img/podman-desktop-release-1.8/deployment-summary.png)\\n\\nSee a problem? You can edit and apply changes direct from the Kube tab.\\n\\n![Deployment Kube YAML](img/podman-desktop-release-1.8/deployment-edit.png)\\n\\n\ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop continues to bridge the gap and discrepancies to empower developers working\\nwith containers with efficient workflows to target Kubernetes from their local workstation.\\nThis is all in addition to some of the great features already available:\\n\\n- Native Kubernetes support with Podman\\n- Podify - transition containers into Pods\\n- Setting up local Kubernetes environments with Minikube and Kind extensions\\n- Deploy to Kubernetes and push local image from Podman to a Kubernetes environments\\n- Managing Kubernetes contexts\\n- Connecting to remote Kubernetes clusters\\n\\n### Global Onboarding\\n\\nConfiguring and setting up a local environment is now easier with the introduction of a new\\nwizard-based onboarding flow. In this flow developers can pick the different tools that they\\nneed, and \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop will walk them through the configuration and setup of each of these\\ntools.\\n\\nThe global onboarding flow allows developers to configure Podman, Compose, and kubectl\\n(needed for working with Kind and Minikube or remote Kubernetes environments). This makes\\nthe transition to \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop becomes simpler, as any needed dependencies are\\nautomatically configured.\\n\\n![Global Onboarding](img/podman-desktop-release-1.8/global-onboarding.png)\\n\\n### Learning Center\\n\\nIn this release, we\'ve added a Learning Center on the Dashboardm enabling developers to\\ndiscover, learn, and expand their knowledge on related topics to containerization. These\\nguides are handy and easily accessible, and cover topics from learning how to containerize\\nan existing application to discovering the latest features of \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop and how to\\nbest use them.\\n\\n![Learning Center](img/podman-desktop-release-1.8/learning-center.png)\\n\\n### Extension API Improvements\\n\\nWe continued spent a lot of time adding new extension API to

Imagine a world where you can effortlessly run Wasm binaries and distribute them using Open Container Initiative (OCI) container images \u2013 a singular image deployable across multiple architectures.\\n\\nThough the concept seemed straightforward, accomplishing this task proved to be quite challenging, particularly on macOS and Windows. The complexity comes from the additional virtual machine running Linux. This machine needs all of the dependencies and prerequisites correctly setup.\\n\\nThe wait is over. Our blog post unveils the solution, guiding you through the process of enabling Wasm workloads on both macOS and Windows.\\n\\n![hero](img/run-webassembly-wasm-workloads-windows-and-macos/webassembly-podman.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is WebAssembly ?\\n\\n[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (abbreviated\xa0Wasm) was designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, improving performance and portability of web applications (including gaming/emulators). Using a low-level binary format instead of JavaScript boosts applications to have near-native performance.\\n\\nThe binary format serves as a compilation target and it allows to use a wider range of programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust. While it was a browser/client technology, now it is evolving beyond the web, for example being adapted for use as a back-end or edge technology (this is for example what happened to Java that was first designed for the client side before landing to the server side).\\n\\nThe Wasm binary format was designed to be secure. Wasm modules are isolated from the rest of the system, and they cannot access any system resources without explicit permission. This makes Wasm modules very safe to run, even in untrusted environments. But on another hand, for developing backend applications, this restriction is limiting the usage of Wasm.\\n\\n## The extension of WebAssembly\\n\\nWebAssembly System Interface (WASI) was born as an essential complement to WebAssembly.\\n\\nIt is a system interface that extends WebAssembly\'s capabilities beyond the browser, making it suitable for a wider range of environments, including servers, edge devices, and more.\\n\\nWhile with Wasm you had limited access to the host resources, WASI provides a standard set of system calls, enabling WebAssembly modules to interact with the host operating system in a secure and consistent manner: it includes filesystem access, sockets, and other low-level resources.\\n\\n## Running WebAssembly outside the browser\\n\\nWasm has shipped in the major browser engines so the usage of Wasm is possible without any 3rd party addition in the browser land. But when it comes to the edge/system usage, you need to find a virtual machine to run these workloads supporting WASI extension. And there is not only one application to run them, there are several Wasm runtimes such as WasmEdge, Wasmtime, Wasmer, and so on. All runtimes support different CPU architectures.\\n\\nSince WASI is still maturing some of the API provided in these runtimes has not reached the standard, so users need to be careful to write portable applications that do not depend on a given runtime.\\n\\nBesides running Wasm/WASI workloads on your computer, there is also the question of how you package this binary format, share, and distribute it. A\xa0convenient way to distribute and run these workloads is to use OCI images as it provides all the basics: package, storage and distribution of the binaries. Then comes the execution part.\\n\\n## Using Podman engine with Wasm\\n\\nWhen using containers with Podman on macOS or Windows, you have a virtual machine called a \\"Podman machine\\" that is executing a Linux environment. We need to add support for Wasm inside this Linux environment. Podman is using the crun project as its OCI runtime, so crun needs to be able to run or delegate execution to Wasm runtimes. Lucky for us, crun supports Wasm execution.\\n\\nFrom the user\'s point of view, support for Wasm is provided as an additional platform. So when executing a Wasm workload, we specify as a platform `--platform=wasi/wasm` instead of for example `--platform=linux/arm64` or `--platform=linux/amd64`.\\n\\n\u200b\\n\\n## Running Wasm workload with podman\\n\\n### Setup\\n\\n<Tabs groupId=\\"operating-systems\\">\\n<TabItem value=\\"win\\" label=\\"Windows\\">\\n\\nOn Windows, ensure that your podman machine is a recent one. You can check using the `podman version` command.\\n\\nDepending on the output of the command, you might have extra steps to do.\\n\\n- Client\'s version and server\'s side version >= v4.7.0: Nothing to do, Wasm support is already there using the wasmedge runtime by default.\\n- Client\'s version >= 4.6.0 but server\'s side version < 4.7.

It helps to consume Wasm binaries. But another interesting case is to distribute and build these Wasm images so anyone could run them quickly.\\n\\nThe goal is to have a minimal image containing only the Wasm binary. For that we will use a multi-stage build. First stage will be the platform to build/compile the `.wasm` binary file and the second/last stage will copy the binary to a scratch image.\\n\\nWhen building images it will use by default the architecture of the host operating system. If you are using a Mac computer with ARM chip, then the Linux images will default to `linux/arm64`. Using a mac/intel it will default to `linux/amd64` images. In the case of Wasm workloads, the expected target platform is\xa0`wasi/wasm`.\\n\\nWith podman we can use the flag `--platform=wasi/wasm` on the `podman build` command to specify the system/architecture. But if we do that, it means that if the Dockerfile or Containerfile contains as base image\xa0`FROM docker.io/redhat/ubi9-minimal`\xa0for example it will try to fetch a `ubi9-minimal` image using the `wasi/wasm` platform but of course it does not exist.\\n\\nSo we need to tweak the Containerfile to include a `--platform`\xa0directive inside the Containerfile.\\n\\nExample of\xa0Containerfile:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nFROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM docker.io/redhat/ubi9-minimal as builder\\n```\\n\\nUsing this method, we will fetch an image matching our host architecture but as there is still the\xa0 `--platform=wasi/wasm`\xa0on the command line, the resulting image will use the right platform.\\n\\n### Source code\\n\\nHere is a simple Containerfile to build a rust application using\xa0wasm32-wasi binary output and a multi-layer OCI image. One layer for the build (installing rust, dependencies and compiling the application) and one scratch layer where we only add the `.wasm` output and flag it as the entrypoint.\\n\\nSource code is available at [https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo/tree/main/wasm/rust-hello-world](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo/tree/main/wasm/rust-hello-world)\\n\\n`Containerfile` content:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\n# Build using the host platform (and not target platform wasi/wasm)\\nFROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM docker.io/redhat/ubi9-minimal as builder\\n\\n# install rust and Wasm/WASI target\\nRUN curl --proto \'=https\' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y \\\\\\n\xa0 \xa0 && source \\"$HOME/.cargo/env\\" && rustup target add wasm32-wasi\\n\\n# copy source code\\nCOPY Cargo.toml /app/\\nCOPY src /app/src\xa0\\n\\n# change working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Build\\nRUN source \\"$HOME/.cargo/env\\" && cd /app && cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release\\n\\n# now copy the Wasm binary and flag it as the entrypoint\\nFROM scratch\\nENTRYPOINT [ \\"/rust-hello-world.wasm\\" ]\\nCOPY --from=builder /app/target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-hello.wasm /rust-hello-world.wasm\\n\xa0\\n```\\n\\nThe `Cargo.toml` content:\\n\\n```toml\\n[package]\\nname = \\"rust-hello-world\\"\\nversion = \\"0.1.0\\"\\nedition = \\"2021\\"\\n\\n[[bin]]\\nname = \\"rust-hello\\"\\npath = \\"src/main.rs\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd the rust program `src/main.rs`:\\n\\n```toml\\n\\n  fn main() {\\n\\n\xa0 \xa0 // use of strings literal for multi-line string\\n\xa0 \xa0 // https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/tokens.html#raw-string-literals\\n\\n\xa0 \xa0 // ascii art from M\xe1ir\xedn Duffy @mairin\\n\xa0 \xa0 let hello = r#\\"\\n!...

With pose, you use a YAML file to configure your application\u2019s services, networks, and volumes. This allows you to capture in a single file the entire configuration necessary to run a set of interconnected containers as an application. For example, if you have an application that requires a web server, a database, and a caching service, you can define these components and their relationships in your Compose file.\\n\\nTo use the Compose YAML, you can use a specification implementation such as [`podman compose`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) and [`docker compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose).\\n\\n## Before we begin\\n\\nIf you do not have Compose installed, let\'s go through the onboarding process to install the Compose implementation binary:\\n\\n1. Get to Resources under **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Resources**.\\n2. Click **Setup** under Compose (it will appear if it has not been installed yet).\\n3. Go through the onboarding process.\\n\\n![Onboarding process](img/getting-started-with-compose/onboarding.png)\\n\\nConfirm that you are able to run `podman compose`:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman compose\\nRun compose workloads via an external provider such as docker-compose or podman-compose\\n\\nDescription:\\n  This command is a thin wrapper around an external compose provider such as docker-compose or podman-compose.  This means that podman compose is executing another tool that implements the compose functionality but sets up the environment in a way to let the compose provider communicate transparently with the local Podman socket.  The specified options as well the command and argument are passed directly to the compose provider.\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Download and run the example application\\n\\nOur example application is located at [github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo).\\n\\nWe will use `git clone` so we can build the Go binary web application:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo\\ncd podman-desktop-demo/guestbook-compose\\n```\\n\\nRun `podman compose up -d` to start the application:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman compose up -d\\n>>>> Executing external compose provider \\"/usr/local/bin/docker-compose\\".

This allows for readability even if the Redis leader is unavailable.\\n- `/env`: View the container\'s environment variables.\\n- `/info`: View information about the Redis cluster.\\n\\n![Guestbook application](img/getting-started-with-compose/helloworld.png)\\n\\n## Viewing and modifying the database\\n\\nUsing Podman Desktop, you can also access the container\'s terminal directly from the GUI and modify the database.\\n\\nClick \\"Open Terminal\\" to access the `redis-leader` terminal:\\n\\n![Open terminal](img/getting-started-with-compose/openterminal.png)\\n\\nModify the database as if you are doing database administration:\\n\\n1. Run `redis-cli` within the container to access the Redis database.\\n2. Type `LPUSH guestbook \\"Hello World!\\"` and you will see your web application update in real-time.\\n3. Type `DEL guestbook` and you will see that your database drops the `guestbook` key and clears the database.\\n\\n![Redis CLI](img/getting-started-with-compose/redis-cli.png)\\n\\nChanges will reflect in real-time on the guestbook.\\n\\nYou can further modify the database and see the changes propagate to the Redis replicas.\\n\\nFor example, view the logs of the `redis-replica`, and you will notice that there are periodic database synchronizations as well as reads to the database:\\n\\n![Redis replica logs](img/getting-started-with-compose/redisreplica.png)\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nA quick overview of how the architecture works in this multi-container scenario:\\n\\n- Within the Guestbook application, it looks for a database with the names `redis-leader` and `redis-replica` on port 6379.\\n- Because it is a Compose application, the containers are connected on the same network. This means that a neighboring container can be network-accessible simply by its container name.\\n\\nThere is a set of environment variables that the web application can modify in the Compose application:\\n\\n- `REDIS_LEADER`: The default is `redis-leader`.\\n- `REDIS_REPLICAS`: The default is `redis-replica`. Can be comma-separated, such as `redis-replica-1,redis-replica-2`.\\n- `REDIS_PORT`: The default is `6379`.\\n- `SERVER_PORT`: The default is `8080`.\\n\\n## Scaling more replicas\\n\\nWant to scale more replicas? This can be achieved by adding an environment variable to your `compose.yaml` and duplicating your `redis-replica` entry.\\n\\nModify your `compose.yaml` as follows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nservices:\\n  redis-leader:\\n    container_name: redis-leader\\n    image: redis:latest\\n    ports:\\n      - \'6379\'\\n\\n  redis-replica:\\n    container_name: redis-replica\\n    image: redis:latest\\n    ports:\\n      - \'6379\'\\n    command: redis-server --replicaof redis-leader 6379\\n\\n  redis-replica-2:\\n    container_name: redis-replica-2\\n    image: redis:latest\\n    ports:\\n      - \'6379\'\\n    command: redis-server --replicaof redis-leader 6379\\n\\n  web:\\n    container_name: web\\n    build: ./web\\n    environment:\\n      - REDIS_REPLICAS=redis-replica1,redis-replica2\\n    ports:\\n      - \'8080:8080\'\\n```\\n\\nRun `podman compose up -d` again to ensure the new container has been added and the new environment variable has propagated:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman compose up -d\\n>>>> Executing external compose provider \\"/usr/local/bin/docker-compose\\".

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### Minikube featured extension\\n\\nFor developers who need to run Kubernetes locally and reproduce an environment close to production for development and experimentation purposes, Podman Desktop allows users to easily set up that environment on a local machine. There are two extensions providing the capability to configure a open source Kubernetes cluster locally, you can either choose between [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).\\n\\nThe Minikube extension allows you to install Minikube on your workstation and also to setup a Kubernetes cluster locally running in a container! Yes, you read that correctly - in a container similar to how Kind works. The advantage is that it\'s lighter and faster to start. With Minikube, one of the advantage, is that you can build your images locally with Podman and get them automatically available in your local Kubernetes cluster - which will speed up your turnarounds when you want to test your application. If you want to learn more this, read the [following blog post](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster).\\n\\n![Minikube-feature-extension](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/minikube-feature-extension.png)\\n\\n### Command-Line Tools Configuration: Compose and Kubectl\\n\\nConfiguring and managing your setup is getting easier with the addition of a new section in the Settings to manage command-line tools. In Podman Desktop, extensions can list command-line tools that are helpful to their users or required to make use of the installed extensions.\\n\\nThere are two command-line tools within Podman Desktop that allows you to view whether they are installed or require an update:\\n\\n- Compose binary for running \'podman compose\' commands.\\n- kubectl for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n![cli-tools](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/cli-tools.png)\\n\\nFrom the settings you can see the command-line tools that are installed, and you can see the version - and when a new version is available, you\'ll get a small notification to allow you easily update to that version.\\n\\n![Compose-Update](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/compose-update.png)\\n\\n### Kubernetes Contexts Manager\\n\\nWe are introducing a new screen available from the Settings which allows you to easily manage your Kubernetes contexts. Podman Desktop was already providing the handy context switcher available from the status bar, but when you get to work with multiple Kubernetes environments, it\'s not uncommon to end with a big and long list of Kubernetes contexts.\\n\\nThe new Kubernetes Contexts screen allows you to easily see all your registered Kubernetes contexts. You can use the screen to clean up your registered contexts, or set the current (default) context.\\n\\n![Kubernetes Contexts List](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/kubernetes-contexts.png)\\n\\n### Editable Podman Machine\\n\\nA Podman machine is a virtual environment specifically designed to run Podman containers on Mac and Windows. It allows users to manage and operate containerized applications in an isolated and controlled setting. When creating a Podman machine, you configure its settings: memory, CPU(s) and disk size.\\n\\nWe\'ve received the feedback regarding the ability to reconfigure your Podman machine on the go. This is now possible for macOS users, and particularly useful when you start with an environment and need to scale it up based on new needs and containers you would like to run in your Podman environment.\\n\\n![Editable podman machine](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/91150767-58a9-47b5-abbc-58d2d50f4fca)\\n\\nYou\'ll notice we improved the sliders to configure the Podman machine\'s options - and also introduced a way to enter numeric values directly.\\n\\n### Tabs/Filters for Containers and Pods\\n\\nBeing able to quickly identify the containers and the pods you are working with is critical when you are iterating on the development of your application. For this reason, we added filters at the top of the lists of Containers and Pods that allow you to easily view all the containers/pods, only those that are running, or only those that are stopped.\\n\\n![Filters for containers and pods](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/37190c74-7fa5-485e-81a4-bd970f606286)\\n\\n### Sorting for Volumes and Images lists\\n\\nThe lists of Volumes and Images have improved and are now have the ability to be sorted by the criteria of your choice. You can for example filter images by their size - which can be convenient when you want to clean up your environment.\\n\\n![Sorting for Volumes and Images](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/0d20b5c2-517c-4ccc-8992-b8df275bcc30)\\n\\n### Environment columns on Containers and Pods lists\\n\\nPodman Desktop is able to work with multiple providers: it could work with multiple container engines and multiple Kubernetes environments too. In order to make it easier to identify the containers and the pods and differentiate them depending on which environment they are running onto, we are introducing a new environment column in the list of Containers and Pods to display a badge.\\n\\n![Environment Column](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/environment-column.png)\\n\\n#### Better visibility to the containers running in Pods\\n\\nThe list of Pods has been refined to provide easier visibility and access to the containers running within each of them. Each of the containers now have one dot and you can hover each dot to display the info about the container - and if you click on it you\'ll be able to access the details of the container.\\n\\n![Visibility for containers in Pods](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/0e88a88e-9a17-4261-b60f-b4d09ca19127)\\n\\n### Extension API improvements\\n\\nThe

One of the challenges we face is quickly iterating when working with container images and kubernetes deployments/pods.\\n\\nFor example, when we want to try a new image in a kubernetes pod, this image needs to be available on a private/public registry or on the nodes of the kubernetes cluster.\\nSometimes we need to call extra commands such as `kind load docker-image` or `minikube cache add <image>` or publish the image first to a 3rd party registry.\\n\\nYou\'ll agree that trying out a new image in a Kubernetes pod should be as seamless as building the image itself.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we will explore the best practice for streamlining the image iteration process in Kubernetes with Podman Desktop.\\n\\n![hero](img/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster/selkie-family.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nWhen using kind or minikube or other 3rd party tools to setup a local kubernetes cluster, we have several ways to publish images.\\n\\nMinikube published 8 ways of doing that at [https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/)\\n\\nThere are pros and cons either way. Using a third party registry implies that you need to publish the image after each build of the image before being able to use it in the kubernetes cluster. While Podman Desktop could automate the synchronization between the local registry (where you are doing `podman build`) and the third party registry, there remains a duplication of layers between the local and third party registry. And if you change the first layer, it can take a lot of time to send again all the data.\\n\\nLoading images requires to pack/unpack the files so it\'s not adequate for large images.\\n\\nMinikube offers a Podman environment, but it\'s important to note that it utilizes version 3.4 inside a container within the Podman machine. This implies the existence of two Podman instances.\\n\\nThe 3.4 version is considerably outdated and do not provide new enhancements and support towards compose, compliance with Docker REST API and 3rd party tools.\\n\\nCould we just build the image and use it in kubernetes?\\n\\n## podman and kubernetes/cri-o\\n\\nIn the kubernetes world, we need a container engine runtime. At the early stage, container runtimes were integrated with ad hoc solutions on top of docker, rkt, or others.\\n\\nBut to separate concerns and to be extensible, a new interface was added: CRI for \\"Container Runtime Interface\\". Using the CRI interface we can plug container engines. And there are several runtimes such as containerd, cri-o and others.\\n[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md)\\n\\nWhat is interesting to us is the cri-o project. This project is implementing the CRI interface but also adopting some projects of the [containers](https://github.com/containers) organization where [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) and [podman-desktop](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) live.\\n\\nSo it means cri-o uses image management from [https://github.com/containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) project and handle storage with [https://github.com/containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage) project.\\n\\nAnd this is what is really interesting as a podman user. As it is using common libraries between cri-o and podman, it means that in the same environment, podman and cri-o read and write the images at a common location in `/var/lib/containers` folder.\\n\\nIf we move one step ahead, if we mount the `/var/lib/containers` folder of podman into the cri-o container it means that the kubernetes cluster could find the images that the podman machine is building.\\n\\nOh wait, it means that no more registry, additional steps would be required? Yes just build and load it.\\n\\n## Minikube to the rescue\\n\\nWhile we have the goal of using both cri-o and podman altogether, we can explore the current projects allowing us to quickly setup kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n### kind\\n\\nOn the `kind` side, there is a default configuration that is using containerd and there is no plan to support an alternative such as cri-o [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1369#issuecomment-867440704](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1369#issuecomment-867440704)\\n\\nThat said, some people try to maintain a way to do that but not officialy [https://gist.github.com/aojea/bd1fb766302779b77b8f68fa0a81c0f2](https://gist.github.com/aojea/bd1fb766302779b77b8f68fa0a81c0f2)\\n\\nBy doing that, we would also need to mount `/var/lib/containers` folder from the host (the podman machine) to the container. And there is no easy flag in kind.\\n\\n### Minikube\\n\\n#### Minikube options\\n\\nMinikube supports more options and provides a way to select the container engine runtime. And it includes support for cri-o.\\n\\nWe can use the `container-runtime` parameter and ask for `cri-o` runtime. Command-line should include `--container-runtime=cri-o`.\\n\\nThen, we do have a podman/cri-o environment inside the container and can use `eval $(minikube podman-env)` to use the Windows/macOS podman CLI.\\n\\nOne issue is that we then have two \'Podman engines\': one running inside the Podman machine and another one running inside the container. The Podman included in the container is using version 3.4, as it\'s on Debian/Ubuntu stable, while the recent version of Podman is 4.7.x.\\n\\nCan we mount the podman machine `/var/lib/containers` into the container ?\\n\\nYes! minikube provides some options to do additional mount with `--mount-string` argument. It is not obvious but you also need to add the `--mount` in addition to this parameter. Full argument is `--mount --mount-string \\"<host-path:container-path>\\"`\\n\\nBut `/var` is already a mounted folder. So here the idea is to change the path of where cri-o is storing its data.\\n\\nSo we can provide a custom mounted path and make cri-o use that custom location. Let\'s pickup `/host-containers`.\\n\\nWhen starting minikube we need then to add `--mount --mount-string \\"/var/lib/containers:/host-containers\\"`.\\n\\nRegarding the configuration of cri-o, currently, it\'s not achievable using Minikube options. However, Minikube does offer the flexibility to modify the base image.\\n\\n#### Minikube kicbase image\\n\\nLet\'s do our own base image named kicbase image.\\n\\nMinikube includes a default configuration file for cri-o.\\n[https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.32.0/deploy/kicbase/02-crio.conf](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.32.0/deploy/kicbase/02-crio.conf)\\n\\nWe need to change this default configuration to say that for storing the images, cri-o needs to use another directory. This new directory `/host-containers` will be mounted from the `/var/lib/containers` folder inside the podman machine. This is how cri-o is able to see podman images.\\n\\nLet\'s include the configuration part in this file.\\n\\n```toml\\n[crio]\\nroot = \\"/host-containers/storage\\"\\nrunroot = \\"/host-containers/storage\\"\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s also upgrade the Podman inside the container by adding the necessary instruction to the Dockerfile.\\n\\nThe Dockerfile is coming from [https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.32.0/deploy/kicbase/Dockerfile#L178-L186](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.32.0/deploy/kicbase/Dockerfile#L178-L186)\\n\\nIn the file, replace\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nRUN clean-install podman && \\\\\\n```\\n\\nwith\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 MD034 --\x3e\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nRUN sh -c \\"echo \'deb https://downloadcontent.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/unstable/xUbuntu_22.04/ /\' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable.list\\" && \\\\\\n    curl -LO https://downloadcontent.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/xUbuntu_22.04/Release.key && \\\\\\n    apt-key add - < Release.key && \\\\\\n    # need to add dbus-user-session else we have\\n    # cannot open sd-bus: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found\\n    clean-install dbus-user-session podman && \\\\\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s rebuild the image and publish it. You can find it at `quay.io/fbenoit/kicbase:multiarch-2023-11-06` .\\nTo build the image, clone [https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) repository, and edit the files referenced before.\\n\\nThe command to build the kicbase image is `make local-kicbase`.\\n\\n#### Trying out cri-o using the podman machine storage folder\\n\\nAt the time of writing this blog post, the version `v1.32.0-beta.0` has been used. For different versions you might need to build your own kicbase image.\\n\\nOne crucial note: cri-o is running in root mode, this is why we mount to `/var/lib/containers` (and then in rootful mode).\\n\\nFor simplicity, let\'s use a rootful podman machine to map the same folder at the two locations.\\n\\nOk now let\'s try in two steps:\\n\\n1. Create a podman machine:\\n\\n```shell\\npodman machine init --cpus 4 --memory 6000 --rootful\\n```\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line --\x3e\\n\\n2. Start the cluster using our kicbase image\\n\\nWe specify Podman as the driver (the default is Docker), state our preference to use cri-o as the container runtime instead of containerd, use our custom image that performs the update of Podman\'s version and the modification of cri-o\'s configuration to use a different storage folder. Finally, we specify an additional mount.\\n\\n```shell\\nminikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=cri-o --base-image=quay.io/fbenoit/kicbase:multiarch-2023-11-06 --mount --mount-string \\"/var/lib/containers:/host-containers\\"\\n```\\n\\n#### Verification\\n\\nAssuming the cluster was able to start, there is a new kubernetes cluster configured in the `$HOME/.kube/config` file.\\n\\nUsing `kubectl` we can start a deployment\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml\\n```\\n\\nyou can check pods are running using\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl get pods -l app=nginx\\n```\\n\\nand if you check your podman images\\n\\n```shell\\npodman images\\n```\\n\\nyou\'ll see nginx being listed so images are shared.\\n\\nNow, you can build image using a Containerfile or pull an image, connect to the control plane instance in Podman Desktop (open a shell in minikube container) and run\\n\\n```shell\\ncrictl images\\n```\\n\\nIt will list the images of podman\\n\\nNote: by default, kubernetes will use the image pull policy `Always` using the `latest` tag on your image. So it might try to fetch/pull/refresh the image you built locally. Use a specific tag or change the `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent` in your deployments.\\n\\nYou can now use your own Containerfile/Dockerfile and build an image using `podman build` command. And then check that the image is available as well in the kubernetes cluster by listing images:\\n\\n```shell\\ncrictl images\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nWe have explored how developers can significantly reduce turnaround times by integrating Podman and Kubernetes seamlessly.\\n\\nNow, let\'s experiment with it and provide feedback through the Podman Desktop issue tracker at https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/ .\\n\\nHere are the next steps Podman Desktop plans to take to enhance ease of use for users:\\n\\n- To make things easier, automate the process by adding this setup to a creation wizard.\\n- Collaborate with upstream Minikube project to simplify choices and remove the requirement for customized kicbase images.\\n- Enhancing the overall user-friendliness of the solution for an improved developer experience."},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-1.5","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.5","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-03-release-1.5.md","title":"Podman Desktop 1.5 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.5 has been released!","date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"},{"inline":true,"label":"openshift","permalink":"/blog/tags/openshift"},{"inline":true,"label":"onboarding","permalink":"/blog/tags/onboarding"},{"inline":true,"label":"compose","permalink":"/blog/tags/compose"},{"inline":true,"label":"extensions","permalink":"/blog/tags/extensions"},{"inline":true,"label":"settings","permalink":"/blog/tags/settings"}],"readingTime":8.18,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"M\xe1ir\xedn Duffy","title":"User Experience Designer","url":"https://github.com/mairin","imageURL":"https://github.com/mairin.png","key":"duffy","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.5 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.5 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-1.5","authors":"duffy","tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes","openshift","onboarding","compose","extensions","settings"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.5/onboarding-selkies.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Share your local podman images with the Kubernetes cluster","permalink":"/blog/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.4 Release","permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.4"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.5 Release! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nWith this release of Podman Desktop, we\'re introducing **a new onboarding feature** that we hope will earn your \ud83e\uddad seal of approval!

Previously autostart had both a global and a per-provider setting. It has been simplified by removing the global setting. [#3840](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3840)\\n\\n- The \\"Working with containers\\" section of the documentation has been reworked and improved. [#3951](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3951)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n- The disable registry command was not blocking subsequent pulls from disabled registries. This has been corrected. [#4183](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4183)\\n\\n- Some users behind network proxies were unable to complete workflow involving the download of online resources. The mechanism for fetching these resources has been fixed to be proxy compatible to address this issue. [#3994](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3994)\\n\\n- The status of pods running in Kubernetes that are undergoing the deletion process is now accurately reflected in the \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop UI. [#3877](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3877)\\n\\n- The image details page always listed the image as being \\"not used\\" even when it was. This has been corrected. [#3985](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3985)\\n\\n- Previously, deleting a specific image tag would cause all tags with the same Image ID to be deleted. This has been fixed so only the selected image tag will be deleted. [#3837](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3837)\\n\\n- Could not view the pod details for some remote Kubernetes cluster pods due to an encoding error. [#4371](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4371)\\n\\n- Error logs were being tracked separately from the actions they applied to. This has been addressed for kind cluster creation failure [#4427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4427) and Compose installation failure [#4407](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4407).\\n\\n- For Linux users, \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop previously did not appear under the \\"Development\\" menu when installed via Flatpak; it appeared under \\"Utilities.\\" \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop now appears under the \\"Development\\" menu.

[#3889](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3889)\\n\\n- Resizing the application window no longer makes the last lines of a container\'s terminal invisible. [#3993](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3993)\\n\\n- An issue with incorrect terminal behavior in response to long lines in the terminal attached to a container has been resolved. [#3955](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3955)\\n\\n- A spacing issue on the run image form has been corrected. [#4089](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4089)\\n\\n- The \\"podify\\" icon & button on the Containers list was unusually large in release 1.4.

Before you were only able to control a group of containers if they were in a Pod. Now we have added the ability to control a group of Compose containers. You can now start, stop, delete and restart a group of containers launched by either `docker-compose` or `podman-compose`.\\n\\nStay tuned as we add even more features to Compose! If you have any feedback or feature requests, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion on GitHub.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/253331226-d80e7637-c223-4bb8-8675-1dcb8d48818f.mov\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### Kubernetes context on the status bar\\n\\nWith Kubernetes context on the status bar, you can switch from one context to another in just a couple of clicks. Easily switch to a different cluster all together. If there are multiple contexts available, you can now click and pick which one to use.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/243804525-242b02b4-fc3c-415b-be08-24eb1933adc5.mov\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### Rename images\\n\\nDeployed an image but now you need to rename it / add a new tag? Podman Desktop allows you to edit an image now. Thanks to an awesome contributor [@tuckerrc](https://github.com/tuckerrc) who added the new feature.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/251759557-bd15a631-93ee-4383-a81c-8ef3934dfb59.mp4\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### Troubleshooting page\\n\\nDeveloping an extension for Podman Desktop?

However, it\\nhas not been easy to discover new extensions.\\n\\nWith 1.0 we show a list of featured extensions in the **Welcome**\\n[#2354](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2354), the **Dashboard** and in\\n**<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Extensions**\\n[#2355](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2355). Check out the new\\nextensions for **Red Hat OpenShift Local** and the **Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift**!\\n\\n![Featured extensions](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/featured-extensions.png)\\n\\n### Featured Extensions\\n\\nSpeaking of extensions, let\'s take a minute to turn the spotlight on these two!\\n\\nHave another idea for extending Podman Desktop? We would love to hear from you or see\\nwhat you can create with the [Extension documentation](/docs/extensions),\\nand feature your extension here.\\n\\n#### Red Hat OpenShift Local\\n\\nOpenShift Local is a fully-featured single-node OpenShift cluster designed to run on your local computer.\\nWith this extension you can install, start/stop, and deploy pods or YAML to OpenShift Local,\\nallowing you to test your applications on a full OpenShift environment, ensuring a consistent\\nexperience between development, test, and production.\\n\\nThe recent addition of the MicroShift preset provides a lighter, optimized option that\\nstarts faster and uses less resources for deployments that still want OpenShift compatibility\\nwithout the full set of OpenShift services.\\n\\n![OpenShift Local](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/openshift-local.png)\\n\\n#### Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift\\n\\nThe OpenShift Developer Sandbox is a free, cloud-based OpenShift environment that allows developers to\\ncreate, build, and deploy applications to OpenShift for 30 days. With this extension you can sign up\\nand easily deploy pods or YAML to a hosted OpenShift environment without a local installation or\\nleaving Podman Desktop.\\n\\n![Developer Sandbox](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/sandbox.png)\\n\\n### Podman Machine as Root\\n\\nWhen creating a Podman machine you can now decide to run as root [#2427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2427). This is a prerequisite for some scenarios, such as running Kind on Windows.\\n\\n![Podman machine as root](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/podman-root.png)\\n\\n### Other UI and UX Improvements\\n\\n#### Prompt to Open External Website\\n\\nIn the previous release links to external websites were blocked due to the security risk.\\nIn 1.0 you can click to see the URL and have the option of opening or copying it\\n[#2414](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2414).\\n\\n![External link dialog](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/external-link.png)\\n\\n#### Editable Numeric Preferences\\n\\nTired of clicking +, +, +? Us too. Numeric preferences are now editable so\\nyou can directly enter the value you want\\n[#2368](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2368).\\n\\n![Editing numbers](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/edit-number.png)\\n\\n#### Navigation tooltips\\n\\nWe like our new navigation bar, but the tooltips were slow to appear. This made it harder for new\\nusers to discover the pages and for power users to see the container/pod/image counts. The\\ntooltips are now a little nicer and appear immediately\\n[#2286](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2286).\\n\\n![Navigation tooltips](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/nav-tooltips.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- If you use a non-default Podman machine you are now prompted to make it the default, so\\n  that command line tools will use the same machine [#2205](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2205).\\n\\n- Extensions can now be installed without requiring a running local container engine\\n  [#2273](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2273).\\n\\n- When extensions fail to load there is a new state (failed!) and an error message\\n  to help you fix or report the problem [#2424](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2424).\\n\\n- The showInputBox API has support for Markdown [#2418](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2418).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Fixed shared status when using multiple Podman 4.5 machines [#2441](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2441).\\n- Fixed hang on exit when telemetry is unreachable [#2431](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2431).\\n- Reduced initial Podman REST API calls to improve performance [#2419](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2419).\\n- **Play Kubernetes YAML** now honors the namespace [#2509](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2509).\\n- **Container** list was not remembering expand/collapsed status [#2491](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2491).\\n- Clear previous error when installing Docker extension [#2469](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2469).\\n- Ensure correct path with running Kind CLI [#2455](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2455).\\n- Use IPv4 over IPv6 by default [#2398](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2398).\\n- When changing the Kubernetes pod name, change the app name to match [#2389](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2389).\\n- Fixed incorrect pod status in **Containers** view [#2387](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2387).\\n- **Dashboard** wasn\'t correctly refreshing Podman status [#2359](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2359).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make Podman Desktop even better.

This opens up more space\\nfor the content on each page, and is easier to jump in and out of **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings**.\\n[#2167](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2167)\\n\\n![Navigation bar](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/navigation.png)\\n\\n#### Updated Dialogs\\n\\nWe wanted messages and dialog boxes to feel a bit more integrated, so we have a new message box\\n[#1808](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1808) and use it for all dialogs opened by\\nextensions, pruning containers/pods/images/volumes [#2138](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2138),\\nand updating Podman Desktop itself [#2249](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2249).\\n\\n![Dialog](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/dialog.png)\\n\\n#### Colors\\n\\nWe spent some time tweaking colors and closing on our final palette\\n[#2199](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2199), updating the colors in the terminal & detail page\\n[#2222](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2222), tweaking the navigation and main page colors\\n[#2223](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2223),\\nand improving the look of forms [#2156](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2156).\\n\\nWe\'re not done yet, but hopefully you will notice a more polished, consistent, good-looking application!\\n\\n### Other UI and UX Improvements\\n\\n#### Markdown Support for Extensions\\n\\nWe added a new component to display markdown [#2219](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2219) and\\nenabled it in preferences [#2253](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2253), and\\nprovider properties/creation pages [#2152](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2152).\\nWe can now embed links and other formatting in preferences, and extensions can use them in many places, for example:\\n\\n![Markdown](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/markdown.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- We know which **Settings** page is used the most often, so now it\'s the default: **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Resources** [#2105](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2105).\\n\\n- Extensions can now use the Tasks API to let long running tasks continue in the background [#2019](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2019) and the existing withProgress API also uses the task manager now\\n  [#2187](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2187).\\n\\n![Task API](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/695993/233560830-85cfa685-5dcd-4efa-9fae-730a8a9eef3b.gif)\\n\\n- Images are now sorted by age [#2311](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2311).\\n\\n- When you start/stop a container or pod, the button is now animated instead of having an separate spinner\\n  [#2101](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2101).\\n\\n- The **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences** page now has a search bar [#2128](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2128).\\n\\n![Search preferences](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/prefs.png)\\n\\n- The Help page has been updated [#431](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/431).\\n\\n![Updated Help](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/help.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n- There was no way to see log or outcome if you leave the Kind cluster creation page [#2079](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2079).\\n- Kind image load doesn\'t show a notification [#2225](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2225).\\n- Fix odd selection in **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Extensions** [#2130](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2130).\\n- Menus are now cleaned up properly when extensions are stopped [#2188](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2188).\\n- Kind clusters are now cleaned up when Podman machine is stopped [#2306](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2306).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final notes\\n\\nThe complete list of issues fixed in this release is available [here](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.15.0).\\n\\nGet the latest release from the [Downloads](/downloads) section of the website and boost your development journey with Podman Desktop.

This allows you to take existing Kubernetes YAML definitions -\\nyour deployments, services, or other objects - and deploy it to the cluster.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/231812563-ece0a56a-b347-48f8-a3a7-400eb9449037.mp4\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\nAs you deploy pods, they will automatically appear in the list of **Pods** [1263](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1263), allowing you to start, stop, and interact them just like pods running on Podman.\\n\\nOne of the most common uses is to deploy a container that you have been running on Podman, and this will fail\\nif the image is not available in Kind. To solve this we have made it easy to push images from\\nPodman to Kind [1448](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1448).\\n\\n![push-image-kind](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/push-image-kind.png)\\n\\n### Kind Ingress\\n\\nIf you deploy a pod to Kind, you are also going to want to reach it! To do this you will need to install a load balancer or\\ningress controller so that the pod is accessible from outside the cluster. We made it easy to install the Contour ingress\\ncontroller while creating a Kind cluster [1675](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1675),\\nso if you created your cluster with Podman Desktop it is already there!\\n\\n![kind-ingress](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/kind-ingress.png)\\n\\nWe have several other Kind and Kubernetes features planned to expand the supported scenarios, but hopefully this\\nmakes it easy to get started with Kind and shows where we\'re headed. As always, feedback is appreciated!\\n\\n### UI and UX improvements\\n\\n#### Updated Preferences\\n\\nThe **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences** page has been updated with a new design [1913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1913),\\nmaking it easier to see and change preferences.

But the UI depends on Docker API and it is not possible to use the UI with Docker and Podman at the same time.\\n\\nPodman Desktop is a multi-engine UI tool. The UI is compatible with the API of Docker and Podman. It means all containers and images from all the engines at the same time are visible in the UI.\\n\\nWhen migrating from Docker to Podman, you can use Podman Desktop to interact with containers running in Docker. Explore all commands and features of Podman Desktop and see all the resources from Docker.\\n\\n![Many container engines at the same time](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/multiple-container-engines.png)\\n\\n## Docker compatibility mode\\n\\nUsing Podman with Podman Desktop or with the Podman CLI is straightforward. But some tools expect to find `docker` CLI or `docker.sock` socket. In this case, you have to use the compatibility mode of Podman.\\n\\n### Socket file compatibility\\n\\nThe socket compatibility mode is a feature of Podman that allows to bind the Podman socket under the Docker socket path.\\n\\nOn Windows the socket compatibility mode is always enabled by default. On macOS, by using the `.pkg installer` it is active by default. But when installing with `brew`, it will not be there because it requires some admin permissions.\\n\\nThat is not an issue because you can enable it by [invoking a CLI tool](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/using-podman-mac-helper) that will setup the compatibility mode.\\n\\nFor example if you use [`Testcontainers`](https://www.testcontainers.com/) in your Java project, you can use the compatibility mode to ensure that the tool will use Podman instead of Docker.\\n\\n### CLI compatibility\\n\\nIf you have scripts relying on `docker` CLI, you can use the compatibility mode to ensure that the tool is working with Podman instead of Docker.\\n\\nIf you have the `docker` CLI installed on your computer, you can use the socket file compatibility of docker to ensure that the tool is working with Podman engine instead of Docker.\\n\\nIf you do not have the `docker` CLI installed on your computer, you can [Create a script](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/emulating-docker-cli-with-podman) called `docker` that will call the `podman` CLI\\n\\n**_NOTE:_** creating a shell prompt alias, for example `alias docker=podman`, will not work inside scripts that you call.\\n\\n## Compose\\n\\nAs a user of Docker, you might use `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`) to run some of your applications.\\n\\nFor now Podman does not include a `Compose` support directly in the CLI with a command `podman compose`.\\n\\n`Compose` can work with the Podman socket.\\n\\nBased on the compatibility mode (see [section about Docker compatibility mode](#docker-compatibility-mode)):\\n\\n- Enabled: you can use the `compose` binary to run your applications.\\n- Disabled: you need to [export the environment variable DOCKER_HOST](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/using-the-docker_host-environment-variable) before running compose.\\n\\nYou can now use the `compose` binary to run your applications and it will use Podman engine.\\n\\nPodman Desktop has a `compose` extension that can fetch `compose` binary if not already available on the filesystem.\\n\\nPodman Desktop UI displays the containers created by `Compose` are in the same group.\\n\\n![Compose support in the UI](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/compose-containers-in-ui.png)\\n\\n## Kubernetes\\n\\nIt is possible to start a Kubernetes cluster with Docker.\\n\\nPodman supports directly a subset of Kubernetes resources that you can use with `.yaml` files.\\n\\nFor example if you only want to create a `Pod` resource, you can use the `Play Kubernetes YAML` button from the `Containers` list screen with your `.yaml` file. No need to install or start a Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n![Play Kubernetes YAML](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/play-kubernetes-yaml.png)\\n\\nIt is possible to do the counter-part. Export the definition of a container or pod to a Kubernetes resource. You can use the `Generate kube` button from the kebab menu of a given container or pod.\\n\\n![Kubernetes generate](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/kube-generate.png)\\n\\nPodman handles pods and in the Podman Desktop UI, you can see all the pods inside a Pod section. All containers inside the pod are in the same group.\\n\\n![Pods in the UI](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/pods-in-ui.png)\\n\\n![Containers from pod](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/containers-from-pod.png)\\n\\nAn experimental `kind` extension is bringing the creation of full-blown Kubernetes cluster with Podman.\\n\\n## Rootless mode\\n\\nOne of the difference of Docker and Podman is the way they handle containers. Docker requires root privileges to run containers by default. Podman can run containers without root privileges by default.\\n\\nIt means that for example, starting a container with a port < 1024 will not work. You need to use a port > 1024.\\n\\nIf you still need to create containers with a port < 1024, you can change the Podman machine configuration of the Podman Machine if you are on Windows or macOS.\\n\\nThe command is `podman machine set --rootful` to enable the execution with root privileges or `podman machine set --rootful=false` to switch back to rootless mode."},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-0.12","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.12","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-15-release-0.12.md","title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.12","description":"Podman Desktop 0.12 has been released!","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":4.475,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Le Meur","title":"Product Manager","url":"https://github.com/slemeur","imageURL":"https://github.com/slemeur.png","key":"slemeur","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.12","description":"Podman Desktop 0.12 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-0.12","authors":["slemeur"],"tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"5 things to know about Podman Desktop for a Docker user","permalink":"/blog/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.11","permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.11"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nThis release note covers Podman Desktop 0.12 release changes.\\n\\n\x3c!--Main Features--\x3e\\n\\n- **Podman Version**: Podman 4.4.1 now included in Windows and Mac installers.\\n- **Containers Configuration**: Configure port mappings for an image without exported ports.\\n- **Windows Home Support**: Podman Desktop now supports Windows Home Edition.\\n- **Start minimized**: Option to start Podman Desktop minimized to system tray.\\n- **UX and UI Improvements**: Consistent actions, placeholder for logs, unified icons and others.\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.12 is now available.

When initializing a new Podman machine using all-in-one binaries, it\'ll use the embedded files and not grab them from internet:\\n\\n- on Mac, it embeds the qemu FCOS binaries.\\n- on Windows, it embeds the WSL binary.\\n\\nTo differentiate the air-gapped binaries from the regular ones, you can check the artifactname, they\'re containing \'airgap\' and are bigger.\\nPlease note, that those binaries are available only on releases and not the pre-releases.\\n\\nThere is also an optional way to provide a custom Podman machine image in the create machine form. By providing the path to the image you want, Podman Desktop will create a machine with that image. Leaving the field empty will use the default image (the one included in the binary).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/210508524-45005536-ac74-4074-92c1-2b3ca51d0073.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### Feedback within Podman Desktop [#1078](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1078)\\n\\nSubmitting feedback on Podman Desktop is getting easier as it is possible directly within the tool. This will help to get more information about the issues you are facing and will help us to improve the tool.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/208938878-948a2764-d73b-4584-a80d-497c052482c1.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\nPlease feel free to submit any feedback you have, we are looking forward to hearing from you!\\n\\n### Docker compatibility mode [#1047](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1047)\\n\\nThe Docker compatibility mode is a feature that allows to use Podman as a drop-in replacement for Docker. It relies on the Docker socket helper provided with Podman and automatically handle the local setup of Podman path to the Docker socket. Tools like [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.com/) or others are relying on this to communicate to the container engine.\\n\\nIn this new version of Podman Desktop, we are now providing information to the user about the status of this compatibility mode directly on the dashboard page. The way it works is the following:\\n\\n- When Docker is running: the socket is pointing to Docker.\\n- When Podman is starting and Docker is not running: the docker API socket will use Podman.\\n\\nIn case the compatibility mode is not activated, new documentation on how to activate it and how to easily switch between Docker and Podman is available here: [https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker).\\n\\nThis is a warning displayed for Windows users:\\n![windows-docker-compatibility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/209305744-9056addd-f122-4f75-9e03-ad27a0109375.png)\\n\\nThis is the warning for Mac users:\\n![mac-docker-compatibility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/207964861-a9c1f72c-89d6-4816-beab-397af4125620.png)\\n\\n### Allow to toggle on/off the proxy setting [#983](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/983)\\n\\nIn some context, users need the ability to disable and re-enable the proxy configuration very quickly, without having to entirely reconfigure it. This is now possible from the Podman Desktop settings page, where a toggle to enable/disable the proxy configuration has been added.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/205955418-670bc37c-a74f-40ef-bc60-8d9d013aa0dc.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\nNote: extensions can read this information and then update the proxy configuration.\\n\\n### Namespace selection for deploy to Kubernetes [#1008](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1008)\\n\\nA new dropdown menu has been added to the deploy to Kubernetes screen to allow selecting the namespace to deploy to. Defaults to defaultnamespace, if unable to get any from kube_client module.\\n\\nIf the user have set `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=NAMESPACE` it honors that as the chosen value.\\n\\n![deploy-kubernetes-namespace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7339809/206688886-095e4f15-42ae-4a0a-b1c6-ae4b547fcdfb.gif)\\n\\n### Configure Podman binary path [#941](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/941)\\n\\nUsers might use a custom path to the podman binary. An option within settings (Settings -> Preferences) to allow providing an additional path to Podman binary has been added.\\nThis is useful for users who have installed Podman using a package manager and want to use the binary provided by the package manager.\\nSee: [Unable to set custom binary path for Podman on macOS](/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-podman-on-macos#unable-to-set-custom-binary-path-for-podman-on-macos)\\n![custom-path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/204832063-5858065a-2fc3-49de-8d23-3b99b7d10dbf.png)\\n\\n### Provide pre-defined registries [#1201](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1201)\\n\\nThe experience of configuring a registry is getting simplified for the most popular ones. The user will be able to select a registry from a pre-defined list and will only have to provide the username and password. The following registries will be pre-defined:\\n\\n- Dockerhub\\n- Red Hat Quay\\n- GitHub\\n- IBM Container Registry\\n- Google Container Registry\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/214332937-eb1d9050-0d32-4bc4-8393-49b4583b1390.mov\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### UI/UX Improvements\\n\\n#### View Pods logs [#1122](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1122)\\n\\nThe pods details view provides the ability to view the logs of each containers that might be running in a pod. Moreover, as it can also be hard to scan and identify which container is producing which output, we appended the container name at the beginning of each output and differentiate each container with a different color.\\n\\n![pods-logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/211024673-eee9bad8-1b0c-4446-b8d1-97a226282c4d.png)\\n\\n#### Improved feedback when clicking on container list action icons [#1150](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1150) [#1161](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1161)\\n\\nWhen starting/stopping or deleting a container, a spinner is now displayed. In case of error, a message indicating that the action failed will also be better indicated.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211531610-2347d302-4918-46ae-a5a2-c80fac0314f5.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\nFor containers that exit immediately or short-lived containers, the feedback is also improved and include report of error now provide a better feedback to the user [#1161](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1161).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211831905-ebf596d5-efc8-4f55-8cb8-3f31655388b9.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n#### Allows to change the default font size for the editor [#1160](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1160)\\n\\nAn editor is used in several screens of Podman Desktop, from the inspect screen to container\'s outputs and Kubernetes YAML. The default font size is 10 pixels. It\'s now possible to adjust the font size to the one the one you prefer. This setting is persisted and will be used for all the editors of Podman Desktop and available from the preferences page (Settings -> Preferences).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211778161-130ff733-b2ca-4306-bea3-d031196c3b29.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n#### Keep expanded state of pods when refreshing containers [#1042](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1042)\\n\\nWhen switching from different screens of the application or simply refreshing the list of containers, the expanded state of each item in the list is now persisted and will be properly restored.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/207864147-b68ea9bd-0ca9-42dc-882e-b8a705233749.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n#### Click on the Pod name redirects to the Pod details page [#1159](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1159)\\n\\nThe list of containers also displays pods, now clicking on the pod name directly redirects to the Pod details page.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing playsinline controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/211770946-2255f39f-7e2e-48ad-9ead-bcbfe6a115a7.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n#### Improved styles of buttons for actions [#984](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/984)\\n\\nThe style of the buttons for actions on item in the list of in details pages have been improved. The background has been removed, but to make the hover state more visible, the \\"hover\\" circle is visible and the icon\'s color is also changing.\\n\\nOn lists:\\n![list-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/205979121-b49a0ddf-03bb-4a4d-8d12-bc8d0bd52387.png)\\n\\nOn details pages:\\n![details-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/205979123-ea420b17-e834-4029-82eb-22949889eee9.png)\\n\\n#### Improved alignments in pages with lists [#1182](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1182)\\n\\nThe alignment of the items in the list of containers and pods have been improved. The header of each columns are now aligned with the text. and the actions icons are now aligned with the top of the text.\\n\\n![list-actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/212712580-096fd090-0beb-40a4-8dc6-b3fdc5e81e35.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- Statistics area in container details are always shown.

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### New configuration wizzard to create containers ([#773](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/773))\\n\\nUntil now, we could only specify port binding when building images to start containers. The create container wizzard now includes several options enabling configuring volumes, environment variables, restart policy and settings on networking and security. It is also possible to reuse an existing (and already configured) a network when creating containers.\\n\\n![new container creation wizard](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/new_container_creation_wizard.gif)\\n\\n### Kubernetes Capabilities Improvements\\n\\n**Custom Kubeconfig file path ([#780](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/780))**\\n\\nKubeconfig path location is now configurable from **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences > Kubernetes: Kubeconfig** and can be set to a custom path. By default, Podman Desktop use the path `$HOME/.kube/config` for the Kubeconfig file.\\n\\n![custom kubeconfig file path](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/custom-kubeconfig.png)\\n\\n**Play Kubernetes YAML from the Pods list ([#739](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/739))**\\n\\nPodman Desktop enables to play existing Kubernetes YAML files. This is now available from `Play Kubernetes YAML` button added to the Pods list, in addition to the Containers list.\\n\\n![play k8s yaml](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/play_k8s_yaml.gif)\\n\\n**Kube context automatically reloaded when updated ([#813](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/813))**\\n\\nAny change to the kube context will now be detected by Podman Desktop in its running state. The system tray, allowing to select which Kubernetes environment to work with, will now reload the kube context without restarting Podman Desktop.\\n\\n### Revamped Container Registries UI ([#446](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/446))\\n\\nThe registries configuration UI has been revamped. Instead of using tiles for displaying the registries, now it uses a list where each registry can be added or edited directly in the list. The kebab menu provides options to edit or remove a registry from the list.\\n\\n![registries](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/registries.png)\\n\\n### Update to Podman 4.3.1 ([#913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/913))\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.10 is now embedding [Podman 4.3.1](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.3.1) in Windows and macOS installers.\\n\\n### UI/UX Improvements\\n\\n**Improved lists UX ([#877](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/877))**\\n\\nTo reduce the width used in the lists when displaying all the icons, main actions icons are now always displayed (before it was on hover) and the secondary actions are displayed in a kebab menu. For example Start/Stop and delete are primary actions while open the browser, inspect, generate kube yaml, etc. are secondary options.\\n\\n![kebab menu](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/kebab-menu.png)\\n\\n**Delay appearance of text in navbar ([#767](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/767))**\\n\\nWhen minimizing or expanding the navbar, the text was overlapping for a few second the page. Now it\'s displayed with a fading animation.\\n\\n**Selected state: better text color contrast ([#802](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/802))**\\n\\nIn the `Images` page, on hover for both the image and the name column, the text contrast has been increased for better visibility: violet indicates that you have selected it.\\n\\n![text color when hover](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/text-color.gif)\\n\\n**On Linux and Windows, the menu bar is now hidden by default ([#668](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/668))**\\n\\nWith this change, the menu bar looks more integrated to the Operating System. The menu can appear if you hit the `Alt` key. Thanks to [Dylan M. Taylor](https://github.com/dylanmtaylor) for contributing to fix this.\\n\\n**Exit when clicking on the close icon of the dashboard on Linux ([#671](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/671))**\\n\\nFor most users on Linux, there is no tray icon support. In this situation, when closed, Podman Desktop continues to run in background. [Dylan M. Taylor](https://github.com/dylanmtaylor) added a property to exit the app by default when clicking on the close icon. For people having tray icon support or with the desire of a different behavior, it is possible to disable it from the Settings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- Rename `Started` into `Age` in Containers list.([#878](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/878))\\n- Added domain validation when adding a registry. ([#838](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/838))\\n- Provided a consistent behavior with Podman CLI, `podman-machine-default` is now the default name when creating a Podman machine from Podman Desktop. ([#775](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/775))\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable bug fixes\\n\\n- Fixed error handling when pulling images of Desktop Extensions. ([#782](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/782))\\n- Fixed use of the full height of the screen when displaying log in the details of a container. ([#946](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions/946))\\n- Fixed First start of Podman Desktop on flatpak was not seeing the podman engine ([#860](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/860))\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make Podman Desktop 0.10 even better:\\n\\n- [Dylan M.

The Development Container works locally using Visual Studio Code but in this blog post we will see how it works directly with a simple click from GitHub.\\n\\nThe challenges are to run a desktop tool (Podman Desktop) and running a container engine (Podman) inside this Development Container without using too many memory !\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Defining image of the container\\n\\nThe first thing is in the choice of the image for the container. It is possible to pick-up a default image and add some features but there is no existing feature for Podman at [https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src) and most of the features are expecting to run on top of Debian/Ubuntu\\n\\nIf you are not interested in how to setup the image, jump to the [next section](#configure-the-devcontainer-using-devcontainerjson).\\n\\nPodman binaries are available quickly after the releases for Fedora. I decided then to use `Fedora 37` as the base image.\\n\\nLet start the Containerfile using:\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM quay.io/fedora/fedora:37\\n```\\n\\nThen I install Node.js 16 from official nodejs.org repository. It\'s easier to switch to the version that we need.\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 --\x3e\\n\\n```docker\\n# install Node.js + yarn\\nENV NODE_VERSION 16.18.1\\nRUN curl -SLO \\"https://nodejs.org/dist/v$NODE_VERSION/node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" && \\\\\\n    tar -xzf \\"node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 && \\\\\\n    rm \\"node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" && \\\\\\n    npm install -g yarn\\n```\\n\\nNow, all system dependencies used to run an Electron application needs to be installed.\\n\\nPodman is also installed so we can run some containers inside this container.\\n\\nAnd of course, we need to install VNC (I choose [tigervnc](https://tigervnc.org/)) with a light Window Manager ([fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)).\\n\\nTo connect to the display of the container, we need to expose VNC over HTML/websocket using [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)\\n\\nxterm is installed to start a terminal from the VNC side.\\n\\n```docker\\nRUN dnf -y update && \\\\\\n    yum -y reinstall shadow-utils && \\\\\\n    yum install -y git \\\\\\n                   # dependencies for Podman Desktop\\n                   nss \\\\\\n                   atk \\\\\\n                   at-spi2-atk \\\\\\n                   cups-libs \\\\\\n                   gtk3 \\\\\\n                   # for remote Display\\n                   fluxbox \\\\\\n                   tigervnc-server \\\\\\n                   xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 \\\\\\n                   novnc \\\\\\n                   supervisor \\\\\\n                   xdpyinfo \\\\\\n                   # for podman\\n                   podman \\\\\\n                   fuse-overlayfs --exclude container-selinux \\\\\\n                   xterm && \\\\\\n    rm -rf /var/cache /var/log/dnf* /var/log/yum.*\\n```\\n\\nSupervisord setup the launch of the VNC server and the Window manager\\n\\n```docker\\nCOPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf\\n```\\n\\nA custom theme for fluxbox:\\n\\n```docker\\nCOPY fluxbox /usr/share/fluxbox/init\\n```\\n\\nThen we need a special configuration to allow to have Podman working inside the container\\n\\nWe add the `podman-desktop` user with correct range on subuid and subgid when running containers. I used the [tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#etcsubuid-and-etcsubgid-configuration).\\n\\n```docker\\nRUN useradd -u 1000 podman-desktop && echo podman-desktop:10000:5000 > /etc/subuid && echo podman-desktop:10000:5000 > /etc/subgid\\n```\\n\\nThen use some default configuration files\\n\\n```docker\\n# initialize conf files\\nADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/libpod/master/contrib/podmanimage/stable/containers.conf /etc/containers/containers.conf\\nADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/libpod/master/contrib/podmanimage/stable/podman-containers.conf /home/podman-desktop/.config/containers/containers.conf\\n```\\n\\nand make sure that all permissions are correct following the guide [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container)\\n\\n```docker\\n# set permissions\\nRUN chown podman-desktop:podman-desktop -R /home/podman-desktop && chmod 644 /etc/containers/containers.conf && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p /var/lib/shared/overlay-images /var/lib/shared/overlay-layers /var/lib/shared/vfs-images /var/lib/shared/vfs-layers; touch /var/lib/shared/overlay-images/images.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/overlay-layers/layers.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/vfs-images/images.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/vfs-layers/layers.lock && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p /run/user/1000 && chown podman-desktop:podman-desktop /run/user/1000\\n```\\n\\nplus define an empty user namespace.\\n\\n```docker\\nENV _CONTAINERS_USERNS_CONFIGURED=\\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nMake sure Podman will create the socket in an expected directory:\\n\\n```docker\\n# socket path for podman\\nENV XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000\\n```\\n\\nOK ! we have a custom Containerfile providing all the tools to build and run Podman Desktop (using VNC for the display), run Podman and run Electron.\\n\\nThe current file is available at https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/.devcontainer/.parent/Containerfile\\n\\nLet\'s configure the DevContainer.\\n\\n## Configure the DevContainer using devcontainer.json\\n\\nDevContainer definition is stored at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.\\n\\nWe need to reuse the image of the previous step. For that let\'s use the build section of the `devcontainer.json` file.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"build\\": {\\n  \\"dockerfile\\": \\"Containerfile\\"\\n},\\n```\\n\\nIn order to avoid to redo all the build steps each time we open a workspace using this dev container, we published the image to quay.io at [quay.io/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent:next](https://quay.io/repository/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent?tab=tags&tag=next). This parent image is not changing much so it\'s better to use is as a parent one.\\n\\nInside `.devcontainer` directory there is a `.parent` directory with everything related to the parent image.\\n\\nAnd in the `.devcontainer/Containerfile` file we reference this image\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM quay.io/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent:next\\n```\\n\\nBy default, we will be `root` in the container and this is probably not what we expect. Let\'s change that.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"containerUser\\": \\"podman-desktop\\"\\n```\\n\\nSome Visual Studio Code extensions are nice to use and we can add them\\n\\n```json\\n  \\"extensions\\": [\\"svelte.svelte-vscode\\", \\"bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThen here is the tricky part, how to run our container allowing to run again inside the container some containers with podman.\\n\\nWe specify the arguments to make it possible. It\'s possible to use `--privileged` flag but I prefer to list the subset of permissions.\\nUsing `--privileged` we don\'t really know what are the privilege that are required while specifying all of them, people are aware of what is granted/denied.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"runArgs\\": [\\n    \\"--cap-add=sys_admin\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"seccomp=unconfined\\",\\n    \\"--device\\",\\n    \\"/dev/fuse\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"label=disable\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"apparmor=unconfined\\"\\n  ],\\n```\\n\\nSource code of Podman Desktop needs to be editable within the DevContainer so it needs to be mounted.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"workspaceMount\\": \\"source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/workspace,type=bind\\",\\n\\"workspaceFolder\\": \\"/workspace\\",\\n```\\n\\nThen we need a command to build Podman Desktop.\\n\\nFor that, we use `onCreateCommand` hook with a custom command\\n\\n```json\\n\\"onCreateCommand\\": \\"${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/onCreateCommand.sh\\",\\n```\\n\\nand in the `.devcontainer` folder the `onCreateCommand.sh` script is the following\\n\\n```shell\\n#!/bin/sh\\nyarn\\n\\nMODE=production yarn run build && yarn run electron-builder build --linux --dir --config .electron-builder.config.cjs\\n```\\n\\nTwo instructions:\\n\\n1. Fetch all Node.js dependencies.\\n2. build Podman Desktop in the `dist` folder using `Linux` as target Operating System.\\n\\nAfter the start of the container, how to launch Podman Desktop, the website and VNC, etc ?\\n\\nJust use `postStartCommand` hook.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"postStartCommand\\": \\"${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/postStartCommand.sh\\",\\n```\\n\\nand in the `.devcontainer` folder the `postStartCommand.sh` script is the following:\\n\\n```shell\\n#!/bin/sh\\n\\n# Start all services\\n/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisord.conf &\\n\\n# wait X server to be ready or after 2mn exit\\necho \\"Waiting for X server to be ready\\"\\ntimeout 120 bash -c \'until xdpyinfo -display :0 &> /dev/null; do printf \\".\\"; sleep 1; done\'\\n\\n# launch podman desktop\\necho \\"Launching Podman Desktop\\"\\ncd dist/linux-unpacked/&& ./podman-desktop &\\n\\n# Launch the 9000 redirect after 20 seconds\\nsleep 20\\nwebsockify --web=/usr/share/novnc localhost:9000 localhost:5900 &\\n\\n# launch the website rendering\\necho \\"Launching Website\\"\\ncd website && yarn start\\n```\\n\\nIt starts VNC and noVNC, start precompiled Podman Desktop and start the documentation rendering.\\n\\nIt is not launching the Watch mode/development mode of Podman Desktop as it requires a container having more than 8GB of memory.\\n\\nPicking up a larger instance with for example 16GB, it\'s possible to use development mode.\\n\\nOf course, to make VNC happy, we need to specify the `DISPLAY` environment variable.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"remoteEnv\\": {\\n  \\"DISPLAY\\": \\":0\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen the DevContainer is fully available, we want to have a way to quickly open the `Website rendering URL` and `noVNC`\\n\\nLet\'s tweak the `devcontainer.json` file by adding the `portsAttributes` section\\n\\n```json\\n\\"portsAttributes\\": {\\n  \\"9000\\": {\\n    \\"label\\": \\"vnc\\",\\n    \\"onAutoForward\\": \\"openPreview\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"3000\\": {\\n    \\"label\\": \\"website\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter all post-creation steps, the `Preview` browser inside the VS Code editor will open a window to VNC. And another port (`3000`) is flagged for the website.\\n\\n## Using the DevContainer.json on Github Codespace\\n\\nAs a user, opening a workspace with all what we configured is done using a single click.\\n\\nGo to https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop then click on the `< > Code` dropdown and click on `Create codespace on main` button.\\n\\n![Open Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-click-repository.png)\\n\\nOnce you click on the button, the codespace is setting up:\\n\\n![Preparing Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-preparing-codespace.png)\\n\\nAfter few minutes, as there is not yet [prebuilt codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds), the codespace is opening.\\n\\nThe simple Browser displays the noVNC window:\\n![Opening Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-open-novnc.png)\\n\\nClick on the connect button. Then on the terminal you can enter `podman run quay.io/podman/hello` and the container is detected in Podman Desktop.\\n![Testing Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-testing-podman-desktop.png)\\n\\nIt\'s also possible using the port widget to get on `3000` port by clicking on the world icon a preview of the website in another tab. Changing source code of the website will refresh the content of the window.\\n\\nDepending on the usecase, it\'s also possible to open documentation in the preview browser.\\n\\n![Edit website Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-edit-website.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe DevContainer image for Podman Desktop is recent so it\'ll probably evolve over time by adding new capabilities but it allows you to easily build/run/experiment and **contribute** to the tool or the website."}]}}')}}]);
